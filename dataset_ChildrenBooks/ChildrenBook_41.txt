13 The Sister of the Sun A long time ago there lived a young prince whose favourite playfellow was the son of the gardener who lived in the grounds of the palace .
14 The king would have preferred his choosing a friend from the pages who were brought up at court ; but the prince would have nothing to say to them , and as he was a spoilt child , and allowed his way in all things , and the gardener 's boy was quiet and well-behaved , he was suffered to be in the palace , morning , noon , and night .
15 The game the children loved the best was a match at archery , for the king had given them two bows exactly alike , and they would spend whole days in trying to see which could shoot the highest .
16 This is always very dangerous , and it was a great wonder they did not put their eyes out ; but somehow or other they managed to escape .
17 One morning , when the prince had done his lessons , he ran out to call his friend , and they both hurried off to the lawn which was their usual playground .
18 They took their bows out of the little hut where their toys were kept , and began to see which could shoot the highest .
19 At last they happened to let fly their arrows both together , and when they fell to earth again the tail feather of a golden hen was found sticking in one .
20 Now the question began to arise whose was the lucky arrow , for they were both alike , and look as closely as you would you could see no difference between them .
21 The prince declared that the arrow was his , and the gardener 's XXXXX was quite sure it was HIS -- and on this occasion he was perfectly right ; but , as they could not decide the matter , they went straight to the king .	boy		boy|child|court|daughter|grounds|monster|nations|way|wonder|world

1 So the marriage was celebrated , and great feasts were held in the palace , though the people wept tears to think of the sad fate of their beloved princess .
2 But when the merry-making was done , and the young couple were alone , the head suddenly disappeared , or , rather , a body was added to it , and one of the handsomest young men that ever was seen stood before the princess . '
3 A wicked fairy enchanted me at my birth , ' he said , ` and for the rest of the world I must always be a head only .
4 But for you , and you only , I am a man like other men . '
5 ` And that is all I care about , ' said the princess .

7 The Sister of the Sun A long time ago there lived a young prince whose favourite playfellow was the son of the gardener who lived in the grounds of the palace .
8 The king would have preferred his choosing a friend from the pages who were brought up at court ; but the prince would have nothing to say to them , and as he was a spoilt child , and allowed his way in all things , and the gardener 's boy was quiet and well-behaved , he was suffered to be in the palace , morning , noon , and night .
9 The game the children loved the best was a match at archery , for the king had given them two bows exactly alike , and they would spend whole days in trying to see which could shoot the highest .
10 This is always very dangerous , and it was a great wonder they did not put their eyes out ; but somehow or other they managed to escape .
11 One morning , when the prince had done his lessons , he ran out to call his friend , and they both hurried off to the lawn which was their usual playground .
12 They took their bows out of the little hut where their toys were kept , and began to see which could shoot the highest .
13 At last they happened to let fly their arrows both together , and when they fell to earth again the tail feather of a golden hen was found sticking in one .
14 Now the question began to arise whose was the lucky arrow , for they were both alike , and look as closely as you would you could see no difference between them .
15 The prince declared that the arrow was his , and the gardener 's boy was quite sure it was HIS -- and on this occasion he was perfectly right ; but , as they could not decide the matter , they went straight to the king .

3 I think it would be best for me to enter and steal the hens , ' said the fox ; but this did not please the boy at all .
4 ` No , it is my business , so it is right that I should go , ' answered he .
5 ` You will find it a very difficult matter to get hold of the hens , ' replied the fox .
6 ` Oh , nothing is likely to happen to me , ' returned the boy .
7 ` Well , go then , ' said the fox , ` but be careful not to make any mistake .
8 Steal only the hen which has the feather missing from her tail , and leave the others alone . '
9 The man listened , but did not interfere , and the boy entered the court of the palace .
10 He soon spied the three hens strutting proudly about , though they were really anxiously wondering if there were not some grains lying on the ground that they might be glad to eat .
11 And as the last one passed by him , he saw she had one feather missing from her tail .
12 At this sight the youth darted forward and seized the hen by the neck so that she could not struggle .
13 Then , tucking her comfortably under his arm , he made straight for the gate .
14 Unluckily , just as he was about to go through it he looked back and caught a glimpse of wonderful splendours from an open door of the palace .
15 ` After all , there is no hurry , ' he said to himself ; ' I may as well see something now I AM here , ' and turned back , forgetting all about the hen , which escaped from under his arm , and ran to join her sisters .
16 He was so much fascinated by the sight of all the beautiful things which peeped through the door that he scarcely noticed that he had lost the prize he had won ; and he did not remember there was such a thing as a hen in the world when he beheld the Sister of the Sun sleeping on a bed before him .
17 For some time he stood staring ; then he came to himself with a start , and feeling that he had no business there , softly stole away , and was fortunate enough to recapture the hen , which he took with him to the gate .
18 On the threshold he stopped again .
19 ` Why should I not look at the Sister of the Sun ? '
20 he thought to himself ; ` she is asleep , and will never know . '
21 And he turned back for the second time and entered the chamber , while the XXXXX wriggled herself free as before .	hen		boy|feather|fox|glimpse|grains|hen|hurry|prize|threshold|world

19 And he waited until he thought that his comrades had gained a good start , and put at least five or six mountains between themselves and the giants .

1 Slowly and sadly the youth left the palace and told his story to his friends , who were waiting outside the gate , how he had actually held the hen three times in his arms and had lost her . '

8 A few minutes later they arrived at the castle , and the fox , who had often been there before , slipped in without difficulty .
9 There were several giants , both young and old , in the hall , and they were all dancing round the princess .
10 As soon as they saw the fox they cried out : ` Come and dance too , old fox ; it is a long time since we have seen you . '
11 So the fox stood up , and did his steps with the best of them ; but after a while he stopped and said : ' I know a charming new dance that I should like to show you ; but it can only be done by two people .
12 If the princess will honour me for a few minutes , you will soon see how it is done . '
13 ` Ah , that is delightful ; we want something new , ' answered they , and placed the princess between the outstretched arms of the fox .
14 In one instant he had knocked over the great stand of lights that lighted the hall , and in the darkness had borne the princess to the gate .

11 ` Do n't be afraid ; she is quite safe . '
12 And he waited until he thought that his comrades had gained a good start , and put at least five or six mountains between themselves and the giants .

14 At these words the giants understood that their prize had escaped , and they ran after the fox as fast as their great legs could carry them , thinking that they should soon come up with the fox , who they supposed had the princess on his back .
15 The fox , on his side , was far too clever to choose the same path that his friends had taken , but would in and out of the forest , till at last even HE was tired out , and fell fast asleep under a tree .
16 Indeed , he was so exhausted with his day 's work that he never heard the approach of the giants , and their hands were already stretched out to seize his tail when his eyes opened , and with a tremendous bound he was once more beyond their reach .
17 All the rest of the night the fox ran and ran ; but when bright red spread over the east , he stopped and waited till the giants were close upon him .

1 There were several giants , both young and old , in the hall , and they were all dancing round the princess .
2 As soon as they saw the fox they cried out : ` Come and dance too , old fox ; it is a long time since we have seen you . '
3 So the fox stood up , and did his steps with the best of them ; but after a while he stopped and said : ' I know a charming new dance that I should like to show you ; but it can only be done by two people .
4 If the princess will honour me for a few minutes , you will soon see how it is done . '
5 ` Ah , that is delightful ; we want something new , ' answered they , and placed the princess between the outstretched arms of the fox .

21 With the golden hen under his arm he presented himself before the king , and told his adventures , and how he was going to have for a wife a XXXXX so wonderful and unlike all other princesses , that the star on her forehead could turn night into day .	princess		cuts|door|forehead|forest|gates|hands|palace|pillar|princess|words

1 His comrades seized hold of her , as they had been bidden , and the fox was back again in the hall before anyone had missed him .
2 He found the giants busy trying to kindle a fire and get some light ; but after a bit someone cried out : ` Where is the princess ? '
3 ` Here , in my arms , ' replied the fox .
4 ` Do n't be afraid ; she is quite safe . '
5 And he waited until he thought that his comrades had gained a good start , and put at least five or six mountains between themselves and the giants .
6 Then he sprang through the door , calling , as he went : ` The maiden is here ; take her if you can ! '
7 At these words the giants understood that their prize had escaped , and they ran after the fox as fast as their great legs could carry them , thinking that they should soon come up with the fox , who they supposed had the princess on his back .
8 The fox , on his side , was far too clever to choose the same path that his friends had taken , but would in and out of the forest , till at last even HE was tired out , and fell fast asleep under a tree .
9 Indeed , he was so exhausted with his day 's work that he never heard the approach of the giants , and their hands were already stretched out to seize his tail when his eyes opened , and with a tremendous bound he was once more beyond their reach .
10 All the rest of the night the fox ran and ran ; but when bright red spread over the east , he stopped and waited till the giants were close upon him .
11 Then he turned , and said quietly : ` Look , there is the Sister of the Sun ! '
12 The giants raised their eyes all at once , and were instantly turned into pillars of stone .
13 The fox then made each pillar a low bow , and set off to join his friends .
14 He knew a great many short cuts across the hills , so it was not long before he came up with them , and all four travelled night and day till they reached the castle of the Sister of the Sun .
15 What joy and feasting there was throughout the palace at the sight of the princess whom they had mourned as dead !
16 and they could not make enough of the boy who had gone through such dangers in order to rescue her .
17 The golden hen was given to him at once , and , more than that , the Sister of the Sun told him that , in a little time , when he was a few years older , she would herself pay a visit to his home and become his wife .
18 The boy could hardly believe his ears when he heard what was in store for him , for his was the most beautiful princess in all the world ; and however thick the darkness might be , it fled away at once from the light of a star on her forehead .

13 The golden hen was given to him at once , and , more than that , the Sister of the Sun told him that , in a little time , when he was a few years older , she would herself pay a visit to his home and become his wife .
14 The boy could hardly believe his ears when he heard what was in store for him , for his was the most beautiful princess in all the world ; and however thick the darkness might be , it fled away at once from the light of a star on her forehead .
15 So the boy set forth on his journey home , with his friends for company ; his heart full of gladness when he thought of the promise of the princess .
16 But , one by one , his comrades dropped off at the places where they had first met him , and he was quite alone when he reached his native town and the gates of the palace .
17 With the golden hen under his arm he presented himself before the king , and told his adventures , and how he was going to have for a wife a princess so wonderful and unlike all other princesses , that the star on her forehead could turn night into day .
18 The king listened silently , and when the boy had done , he said quietly : ` If I find that your story is not true I will have you thrown into a cask of pitch . '
19 ` It is true -- every word of it , ' answered the boy ; and went on to tell that the day and even the hour were fixed when his bride was to come and seek him .
20 But as the time drew near , and nothing was heard of the princess , the youth became anxious and uneasy , especially when it came to his ears that the great cask was being filled with pitch , and that sticks were laid underneath to make a fire to boil it with .
21 All day long the boy stood at the window , looking over the sea by which the XXXXX must travel ; but there were no signs of her , not even the tiniest white sail .	princess		back|castle|forest|hen|princess|prize|sticks|tail|work|youth

2 At these words the giants understood that their prize had escaped , and they ran after the fox as fast as their great legs could carry them , thinking that they should soon come up with the fox , who they supposed had the princess on his back .
3 The fox , on his side , was far too clever to choose the same path that his friends had taken , but would in and out of the forest , till at last even HE was tired out , and fell fast asleep under a tree .

14 The king listened silently , and when the boy had done , he said quietly : ` If I find that your story is not true I will have you thrown into a cask of pitch . '
15 ` It is true -- every word of it , ' answered the boy ; and went on to tell that the day and even the hour were fixed when his bride was to come and seek him .
16 But as the time drew near , and nothing was heard of the princess , the youth became anxious and uneasy , especially when it came to his ears that the great cask was being filled with pitch , and that sticks were laid underneath to make a fire to boil it with .
17 All day long the boy stood at the window , looking over the sea by which the princess must travel ; but there were no signs of her , not even the tiniest white sail .
18 And , as he stood , soldiers came and laid hands on him , and led him up to the cask , where a big fire was blazing , and the horrid black pitch boiling and bubbling over the sides .

1 Indeed , he was so exhausted with his day 's work that he never heard the approach of the giants , and their hands were already stretched out to seize his tail when his eyes opened , and with a tremendous bound he was once more beyond their reach .
2 All the rest of the night the fox ran and ran ; but when bright red spread over the east , he stopped and waited till the giants were close upon him .
3 Then he turned , and said quietly : ` Look , there is the Sister of the Sun ! '
4 The giants raised their eyes all at once , and were instantly turned into pillars of stone .
5 The fox then made each pillar a low bow , and set off to join his friends .
6 He knew a great many short cuts across the hills , so it was not long before he came up with them , and all four travelled night and day till they reached the castle of the Sister of the Sun .
7 What joy and feasting there was throughout the palace at the sight of the princess whom they had mourned as dead !
8 and they could not make enough of the boy who had gone through such dangers in order to rescue her .
9 The golden hen was given to him at once , and , more than that , the Sister of the Sun told him that , in a little time , when he was a few years older , she would herself pay a visit to his home and become his wife .
10 The boy could hardly believe his ears when he heard what was in store for him , for his was the most beautiful princess in all the world ; and however thick the darkness might be , it fled away at once from the light of a star on her forehead .
11 So the boy set forth on his journey home , with his friends for company ; his heart full of gladness when he thought of the promise of the princess .
12 But , one by one , his comrades dropped off at the places where they had first met him , and he was quite alone when he reached his native town and the gates of the palace .

1 With the golden hen under his arm he presented himself before the king , and told his adventures , and how he was going to have for a wife a princess so wonderful and unlike all other princesses , that the star on her forehead could turn night into day .
2 The king listened silently , and when the boy had done , he said quietly : ` If I find that your story is not true I will have you thrown into a cask of pitch . '
3 ` It is true -- every word of it , ' answered the boy ; and went on to tell that the day and even the hour were fixed when his bride was to come and seek him .
4 But as the time drew near , and nothing was heard of the princess , the youth became anxious and uneasy , especially when it came to his ears that the great cask was being filled with pitch , and that sticks were laid underneath to make a fire to boil it with .
5 All day long the boy stood at the window , looking over the sea by which the princess must travel ; but there were no signs of her , not even the tiniest white sail .
6 And , as he stood , soldiers came and laid hands on him , and led him up to the cask , where a big fire was blazing , and the horrid black pitch boiling and bubbling over the sides .
7 He looked and shuddered , but there was no escape ; so he shut his eyes to avoid seeing .
8 The word was given for him to mount the steps which led to the top of the cask , when , suddenly , some men were seen running with all their might , crying as they went that a large ship with its sails spread was making straight for the city .
9 No one knew what the ship was , or whence it came ; but the king declared that he would not have the boy burned before its arrival , there would always be time enough for that .
10 At length the vessel was safe in port , and a whisper went through the watching crowd that on board was the Sister of the Sun , who had come to marry the young peasant as she had promised .
11 In a few moments more she had landed , and desired to be shown the way to the cottage which her bridegroom had so often described to her ; and whither he had been led back by the king 's order at the first sign of the ship .

9 He had never cut down a tree in his life , and had not the least idea how to begin .
10 And as for a whole forest -- !
11 But the princess saw what was passing in his mind , and whispered to him : ` Do n't be afraid .
12 In my ship you will find an axe , which you must carry off to the forest .
13 When you have cut down one tree with it just say : `` So let the forest fall , '' and in an instant all the trees will be on the ground .
14 But pick up three chips of the tree you felled , and put them in your pocket . '
15 And the young man did exactly as he was bid , and soon returned with the three chips safe in his coat .
16 The following morning the princess declared that she had been thinking about the matter , and that , as she was not a subject of the king , she saw no reason why she should be bound by his laws ; and she meant to be married that very day .
17 But the bridegroom 's father told her that it was all very well for her to talk like that , but it was quite different for his son , who would pay with his head for any disobedience to the king 's commands .
18 However , in consideration of what the youth had done the day before , he hoped his majesty 's heart might be softened , especially as he had sent a message that they might expect him at once .
19 With this the bridal pair had to be content , and be as patient as they could till the king 's arrival .
20 He did not keep them long , but they saw by his face that nothing good awaited them .
21 ` The XXXXX can not take place , ' he said shortly , 'till the youth has joined to their roots all the trees he cut down yesterday . '	marriage		bid|chips|head|heart|law|man|marriage|matter|street|words

1 He staggered back as if he had been struck , then a curious feeling took hold of him , which he had never felt before , and falling on his knees before the Sister of the Sun , he implored her to give up all thought of the peasant boy , and to share his throne .
2 But she laughed , and said she had a finer throne of her own , if she wanted to sit on it , and that she was free to please herself , and would have no husband but the boy whom she would never have seen except for the king himself . '
3 I shall marry him to-morrow , ' ended she ; and ordered the preparations to be set on foot at once .
4 When the next day came , however , the bridegroom 's father informed the princess that , by the law of the land , the marriage must take place in the presence of the king ; but he hoped his majesty would not long delay his arrival .
5 An hour or two passed , and everyone was waiting and watching , when at last the sound of trumpets was heard and a grand procession was seen marching up the street .
6 A chair covered with velvet had been made ready for the king , and he took his seat upon it , and , looking round upon the assembled company , he said : ' I have no wish to forbid this marriage ; but , before I can allow it to be celebrated , the bridegroom must prove himself worthy of such a bride by fulfilling three tasks .
7 And the first is that in a single day he must cut down every tree in an entire forest .
