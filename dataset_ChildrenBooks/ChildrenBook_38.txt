4 But though she was very good-natured , she was not very clever , and she got some of the bits wrong .
5 When the wolverine , who was very particular about his clothes , came to put it on , he grew very angry .
6 ` What a useless creature you are ! '
7 cried he .
8 ` Do you expect me to go about in such a coat as that ?
9 Why it bulges all down the back , as if I had a hump , and it is so tight across the chest that I expect it to burst every time I breathe .

11 And giving the poor frog a blow on her head , which knocked her straight into the water , he walked off in a rage to his younger sister the mouse . '
12 I tore my coat this morning , ' he began , when he had found her sitting at the door of her house eating an apple .
13 ` It was all in little bits , and I took it to our sister the frog to ask her to sew it for me .
14 But just look at the way she has done it !
15 You will have to take it to pieces and fit them together properly , and I hope I shall not have to complain again . '
16 For as the wolverine was older than the mouse , he was accustomed to speak to her in this manner .
17 However , the mouse was used to it and only answered : ' I think you had better stay here till it is done , and if there is any alteration needed I can make it . '
18 So the wolverine sat down on a heap of dry ferns , and picking up the apple , he finished it without even asking the mouse 's leave .
19 At last the coat was ready , and the wolverine put it on .
20 ` Yes , it fits very well , ' said he , ` and you have sewn it very neatly .
21 When I pass this XXXXX again I will bring you a handful of corn , as a reward ' ; and he ran off as smart as ever , leaving the mouse quite grateful behind him .	way		coat|ferns|frog|heap|needle|pieces|rage|sister|thread|way

9 Now the wolverine was very angry when he saw his dinner vanishing in front of him , especially as HE could not climb trees like the bear , so he followed , and stood at the foot of the tree , shrieking as loud as he could , ` Come down , sister ; our father has sent me to look for you !
10 You were lost when you were a little girl and went out picking berries , and it was only the other day that we heard from a beaver where you were . '
11 At these words , the bear came a little way down the tree , and the wolverine , seeing this , went on : ` Are you not fond of berries ?
12 I am !
13 And I know a place where they grow so thick the ground is quite hidden .

17 ` You must have wonderfully good eyes !
18 I wish I had ; but my sight is very short . '
19 ` So was mine till my father smashed a pailful of cranberries , and rubbed my eyes with them , ' replied the wolverine .
20 ` But if you like to go and gather some of the berries I will do just as he did , and you will soon be able to see as far as me . '

2 The Husband of the Rat 's Daughter Once upon a time there lived in Japan a rat and his wife who came of an old and noble race , and had one daughter , the loveliest girl in all the rat world .

4 There was not another young lady in the whole town who was as clever as she was in gnawing through the hardest wood , or who could drop from such a height on to a bed , or run away so fast if anyone was heard coming .
5 Great attention , too , was paid to her personal appearance , and her skin shone like satin , while her teeth were as white as pearls , and beautifully pointed .
6 Of course , with all these advantages , her parents expected her to make a brilliant marriage , and , as she grew up , they began to look round for a suitable husband .
7 But here a difficulty arose .
8 The father was a rat from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail , outside as well as in , and desired that his daughter should wed among her own people .
9 She had no lack of lovers , but her father 's secret hopes rested on a fine young rat , with moustaches which almost swept the ground , whose family was still nobler and more ancient than his own .

15 What the girl thought about the matter nobody knew or cared -- it was not the fashion in the rat world .

1 He hoped that some day he might have children in his home , and the thought that he must yield up the heir to his crown was very bitter to him ; but just then a huge wave broke with great force on the ship 's side , and his men fell on their knees and entreated him to save them .
2 So he promised , and this time a wave lifted the vessel clean off the rocks , and she was in the open sea once more .
3 The affairs of the islands took longer to settle than the king had expected , and some months passed away before he returned to his palace .
4 In his absence a son had been born to him , and so great was his joy that he quite forgot the mermaid and the price he had paid for the safety of his ship .
5 But as the years went on , and the baby grew into a fine big boy , the remembrance of it came back , and one day he told the queen the whole story .
6 From that moment the happiness of both their lives was ruined .
7 Every night they went to bed wondering if they should find his room empty in the morning , and every day they kept him by their sides , expecting him to be snatched away before their very eyes .
8 At last the king felt that this state of things could not continue , and he said to his wife : ` After all , the most foolish thing in the world one can do is to keep the boy here in exactly the place in which the mermaid will seek him .
9 Let us give him food and send him on his travels , and perhaps , if the mermaid ever blocs come to seek him , she may be content with some other child . '
10 And the queen agreed that his plan seemed the wisest .
11 So the boy was called , and his father told him the story of the voyage , as he had told his mother before him .
12 The prince listened eagerly , and was delighted to think that he was to go away all by himself to see the world , and was not in the least frightened ; for though he was now sixteen , he had scarcely been allowed to walk alone beyond the palace gardens .
13 He began busily to make his preparations , and took off his smart velvet coat , putting on instead one of green cloth , while he refused a beautiful bag which the queen offered him to hold his food , and slung a leather knapsack over his shoulders instead , just as he had seen other travellers do .
14 Then he bade farewell to his parents and went his way .
15 All through the day he walked , watching with interest the strange birds and animals that darted across his path in the forest or peeped at him from behind a bush .
16 But as evening drew on he became tired , and looked about as he walked for some place where he could sleep .
17 At length he reached a soft mossy bank under a tree , and was just about to stretch himself out on it , when a fearful roar made him start and tremble all over .
18 In another moment something passed swiftly through the air and a lion stood before him .

5 In another moment something passed swiftly through the air and a lion stood before him .
6 ` What are you doing here ? '

8 I am flying from the mermaid , ' the prince answered , in a quaking voice .
9 ` Give me some food then , ' said the lion , ` it is past my supper time , and I am very hungry . '
10 The boy was so thankful that the lion did not want to eat him , that he gladly picked up his knapsack which lay on the ground , and held out some bread and a flask of wine . '
11 I feel better now , ' said the lion when he had done , ` so now I shall go to sleep on this nice soft moss , and if you like you can lie down beside me . '
12 So the boy and the lion slept soundly side by side , till the sun rose . '
13 I must be off now , ' remarked the lion , shaking the boy as he spoke ; ` but cut off the tip of my ear , and keep it carefully , and if you are in any danger just wish yourself a lion and you will become one on the spot .

15 The prince thanked him for his kindness , and did as he was bid , and the two then bade each other farewell . '
16 I wonder how it feels to be a lion , ' thought the boy , after he had gone a little way ; and he took out the tip of the ear from the breast of his jacket and wished with all his might .
17 In an instant his head had swollen to several times its usual size , and his neck seemed very hot and heavy ; and , somehow , his hands became paws , and his skin grew hairy and yellow .
18 But what pleased him most was his long tail with a tuft at the end , which he lashed and switched proudly . '
19 I like being a lion very much , ' he said to himself , and trotted gaily along the road .
20 After a while , however , he got tired of walking in this unaccustomed way -- it made his back ache and his front paws felt sore .
21 So he wished himself a boy again , and in the twinkling of an eye his tail disappeared and his XXXXX shrank , and the long thick mane became short and curly .	head		bid|ear|eyes|food|forest|head|kindness|might|path|paws

1 ` Give me some food then , ' said the lion , ` it is past my supper time , and I am very hungry . '
2 The boy was so thankful that the lion did not want to eat him , that he gladly picked up his knapsack which lay on the ground , and held out some bread and a flask of wine . '
3 I feel better now , ' said the lion when he had done , ` so now I shall go to sleep on this nice soft moss , and if you like you can lie down beside me . '
4 So the boy and the lion slept soundly side by side , till the sun rose . '
5 I must be off now , ' remarked the lion , shaking the boy as he spoke ; ` but cut off the tip of my ear , and keep it carefully , and if you are in any danger just wish yourself a lion and you will become one on the spot .
6 One good turn deserves another , you know . '
7 The prince thanked him for his kindness , and did as he was bid , and the two then bade each other farewell . '
8 I wonder how it feels to be a lion , ' thought the boy , after he had gone a little way ; and he took out the tip of the ear from the breast of his jacket and wished with all his might .
9 In an instant his head had swollen to several times its usual size , and his neck seemed very hot and heavy ; and , somehow , his hands became paws , and his skin grew hairy and yellow .
10 But what pleased him most was his long tail with a tuft at the end , which he lashed and switched proudly . '
11 I like being a lion very much , ' he said to himself , and trotted gaily along the road .
12 After a while , however , he got tired of walking in this unaccustomed way -- it made his back ache and his front paws felt sore .
13 So he wished himself a boy again , and in the twinkling of an eye his tail disappeared and his head shrank , and the long thick mane became short and curly .
14 Then he looked out for a sleeping place , and found some dry ferns , which he gathered and heaped up .
15 But before he had time to close his eyes there was a great noise in the trees near by , as if a big heavy body was crashing through them .
16 The boy rose and turned his head , and saw a huge black bear coming towards him .
17 ` What are you doing here ? '
18 cried the bear . '
19 I am running away from the mermaid , ' answered the boy ; but the bear took no interest in the mermaid , and only said : ' I am hungry ; give me something to eat . '

1 Late in the afternoon the boy fancied he saw a vast heap of stones a long way off , and he flew straight towards it .
2 But when he reached the gates he saw that it was really a great town , so he wished himself back in his own shape and entered the city .
3 He found the palace doors wide open and went boldly into a sort of hall which was full of people , and where men and maids were gossiping together .
4 He joined their talk and soon learned from them that the king had only one daughter who had such a hatred to men that she would never suffer one to enter her presence .
5 Her father was in despair , and had had pictures painted of the handsomest princes of all the courts in the world , in the hope that she might fall in love with one of them ; but it was no use ; the princess would not even allow the pictures to be brought into her room .

9 I am used to nothing better . '

11 But as soon as everything was quiet in the palace he took out the hair and wished himself a bee , and in this shape he flew upstairs , past the guards , and through the keyhole into the princess 's chamber .
12 Then he turned himself into a man again .
13 At this dreadful sight the princess , who was broad awake , began to scream loudly . '
14 A man !

16 cried she ; but when the guards rushed in there was only a bumble-bee buzzing about the room .
