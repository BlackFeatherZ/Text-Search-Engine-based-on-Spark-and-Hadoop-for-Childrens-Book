4 ` You have a long way before you , my son , ' said the old woman ; ` you must never return till you have met with Lucky Luck .
5 If he can not help you no one on earth can . '
6 So the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck .
7 He walked and walked till he got beyond his own country , and he wandered through a wood for three days but did not meet a living being in it .
8 At the end of the third day he came to a river near which stood a large mill .
9 Here he spent the night .
10 When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him : ` My gracious lord , where are you going all alone ? '
11 And the prince told him .
12 ` Then I beg your Highness to ask Lucky Luck this question : Why is it that though I have an excellent mill , with all its machinery complete , and get plenty of grain to grind , I am so poor that I hardly know how to live from one day to another ? '
13 The prince promised to inquire , and went on his way .
14 He wandered about for three days more , and at the end of the third day saw a little town .
15 It was quite late when he reached it , but he could discover no light anywhere , and walked almost right through it without finding a house where he could turn in .
16 But far away at the end of the town he saw a light in a window .
17 He went straight to it and in the house were three girls playing a game together .
18 The prince asked for a night 's lodging and they took him in , gave him some supper and got a room ready for him , where he slept .
19 Next morning when he was leaving they asked where he was going and he told them his story .
20 ` Gracious prince , ' said the maidens , ` do ask Lucky Luck how it happens that here we are over thirty years old and no lover has come to woo us , though we are good , pretty , and very industrious . '
21 The XXXXX promised to inquire , and went on his way .	prince		Court|care|girls|living|lord|morning|prince|room|story|supper

11 The Hairy Man Somewhere or other , but I do n't know where , there lived a king who owned two remarkably fine fields of rape , but every night two of the rape heaps were burnt down in one of the fields .
12 The king was extremely angry at this , and sent out soldiers to catch whoever had set fire to the ricks ; but it was all of no use -- not a soul could they see .
13 Then he offered nine hundred crowns to anyone who caught the evil-doer , and at the same time ordered that whoever did not keep proper watch over the fields should be killed ; but though there were a great many people , none seemed able to protect the fields .
14 The king had already put ninety-nine people to death , when a little swineherd came to him who had two dogs ; one was called ` Psst , ' and the other ` Hush ' ; and the boy told the king that he would watch over the ricks .
15 When it grew dark he climbed up on the top of the fourth rick , from where he could see the whole field .
16 About eleven o'clock he thought he saw someone going to a rick and putting a light to it .
17 ` Just you wait , ' thought he , and called out to his dogs : ` Hi !
18 Psst , Hush , catch him ! '
19 But Psst and Hush had not waited for orders , and in five minutes the man was caught .
20 Next morning he was brought bound before the king , who was so pleased with the boy that he gave him a thousand crowns at once .
21 The prisoner was all covered with hair , almost like an animal ; and altogether he was so curious to look at that the XXXXX locked him up in a strong room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come and see this wonder .	king		Hush|baby|boy|crowns|home|king|miller|morning|soldiers|stream

2 The Hairy Man Somewhere or other , but I do n't know where , there lived a king who owned two remarkably fine fields of rape , but every night two of the rape heaps were burnt down in one of the fields .
3 The king was extremely angry at this , and sent out soldiers to catch whoever had set fire to the ricks ; but it was all of no use -- not a soul could they see .
4 Then he offered nine hundred crowns to anyone who caught the evil-doer , and at the same time ordered that whoever did not keep proper watch over the fields should be killed ; but though there were a great many people , none seemed able to protect the fields .
5 The king had already put ninety-nine people to death , when a little swineherd came to him who had two dogs ; one was called ` Psst , ' and the other ` Hush ' ; and the boy told the king that he would watch over the ricks .
6 When it grew dark he climbed up on the top of the fourth rick , from where he could see the whole field .
7 About eleven o'clock he thought he saw someone going to a rick and putting a light to it .
8 ` Just you wait , ' thought he , and called out to his dogs : ` Hi !
9 Psst , Hush , catch him ! '
10 But Psst and Hush had not waited for orders , and in five minutes the man was caught .
11 Next morning he was brought bound before the king , who was so pleased with the boy that he gave him a thousand crowns at once .
12 The prisoner was all covered with hair , almost like an animal ; and altogether he was so curious to look at that the king locked him up in a strong room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come and see this wonder .
13 That was all very well ; but the king had a little boy of ten years old who went to look at the hairy man also , and the man begged so hard to be set free that the boy took pity on him .
14 He stole the key of the strong room from his mother and opened the door .
15 Then he took the key back , but the hairy man escaped and went off into the world .
16 Then the kings and princes began to arrive one after another , and all were most anxious to see the hairy man ; but he was gone !

6 The prisoner was all covered with hair , almost like an animal ; and altogether he was so curious to look at that the king locked him up in a strong room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come and see this wonder .
7 That was all very well ; but the king had a little boy of ten years old who went to look at the hairy man also , and the man begged so hard to be set free that the boy took pity on him .

14 So they fetched the little prince and asked him all sorts of questions , and at last he owned that he had let the hairy man out .
15 The king ordered his servants to take the boy into the forest and to kill him there , and to bring back part of his liver and lungs .
16 There was grief all over the palace when the king 's command was known , for he was a great favourite .

15 The old man also gave him a silver apple out of which came the most beautiful hussars and a silver staff ; and a copper apple from which he could draw as many foot soldiers as ever he wished , and a copper staff .

2 One day , as the princesses were talking with their father , the younger one asked him whether it might not have been their servant who had helped him so much .
3 The king was quite angry at the idea ; but , to satisfy her , he ordered the servant 's room to be searched .
4 And there , to everyone 's surprise , they found the golden ring and the half of the handkerchief .

16 But the shepherd answered : ' I am not afraid of ten deaths !
17 I will only say it if I may have the princess for my wife . '
18 ` Then go to your death , ' cried the king ; and ordered him to be thrown into the den with the wild boars .
19 The wild boars had not been fed for a week , and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him to tear him to pieces .
20 But the shepherd took a little flute out of the sleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune , on which the wild boars first of all shrank shyly away , and then got up on their hind legs and danced gaily .
21 The XXXXX would have given anything to be able to laugh , they looked so funny ; but he dared not stop playing , for he knew well enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear him to pieces .	shepherd		corner|course|daughter|fact|moment|order|rage|shepherd|songs|tune

2 ` To mine , to mine , your Majesty , ' was the answer .
3 ` But to mine -- to my own , ' roared the king , and beat on his breast in a rage .
4 ` Well , yes ; to mine , of course , to my own , ' cried the shepherd , and gently tapped his breast .
5 The king was beside himself with fury and did not know what to do , when the Lord Chamberlain interfered : ` Say at once -- say this very moment : `` To your health , your Majesty '' ; for if you do n't say it you 'll lose your life , whispered he .
6 ` No , I wo n't say it till I get the princess for my wife , ' was the shepherd 's answer .
7 Now the princess was sitting on a little throne beside the king , her father , and she looked as sweet and lovely as a little golden dove .
8 When she heard what the shepherd said she could not help laughing , for there is no denying the fact that this young shepherd with the staring eyes pleased her very much ; indeed he pleased her better than any king 's son she had yet seen .
9 But the king was not as pleasant as his daughter , and he gave orders to throw the shepherd into the white bear 's pit .
10 The guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white bear , who had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry .
11 The door of the pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd ; but when it saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself .
12 It shrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there , and , in spite of being so famished , did not dare to touch him , but sucked its own paws from sheer hunger .
13 The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes off the beast he was a dead man , and in order to keep himself awake he made songs and sang them , and so the night went by .
14 Next morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd 's bones , and was amazed to find him alive and well .

20 As soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before him ; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not torn the man to bits , and he said : ` Well , you have learned what it feels to be near ten deaths , now say `` To my good health ! '' '

1 ` No , I wo n't say it till I get the princess for my wife , ' was the shepherd 's answer .
2 Now the princess was sitting on a little throne beside the king , her father , and she looked as sweet and lovely as a little golden dove .
3 When she heard what the shepherd said she could not help laughing , for there is no denying the fact that this young shepherd with the staring eyes pleased her very much ; indeed he pleased her better than any king 's son she had yet seen .
4 But the king was not as pleasant as his daughter , and he gave orders to throw the shepherd into the white bear 's pit .
5 The guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white bear , who had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry .
6 The door of the pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd ; but when it saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself .
7 It shrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there , and , in spite of being so famished , did not dare to touch him , but sucked its own paws from sheer hunger .
8 The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes off the beast he was a dead man , and in order to keep himself awake he made songs and sang them , and so the night went by .
9 Next morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd 's bones , and was amazed to find him alive and well .
10 He led him to the king , who fell into a furious passion , and said : ` Well , you have learned what it is to be very near death , and now will you say `` To my good health '' ? '
11 But the shepherd answered : ' I am not afraid of ten deaths !
12 I will only say it if I may have the princess for my wife . '
13 ` Then go to your death , ' cried the king ; and ordered him to be thrown into the den with the wild boars .
14 The wild boars had not been fed for a week , and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him to tear him to pieces .
15 But the shepherd took a little flute out of the sleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune , on which the wild boars first of all shrank shyly away , and then got up on their hind legs and danced gaily .
16 The shepherd would have given anything to be able to laugh , they looked so funny ; but he dared not stop playing , for he knew well enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear him to pieces .
17 His eyes were of no use to him here , for he could not have stared ten wild boars in the face at once ; so he kept on playing , and the wild boars danced very slowly , as if in a minuet , then by degrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and turn quickly enough , and ended by all falling over each other in a heap , quite exhausted and out of breath .

1 The door of the pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd ; but when it saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat itself .
2 It shrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there , and , in spite of being so famished , did not dare to touch him , but sucked its own paws from sheer hunger .
3 The shepherd felt that if he once removed his eyes off the beast he was a dead man , and in order to keep himself awake he made songs and sang them , and so the night went by .
4 Next morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the shepherd 's bones , and was amazed to find him alive and well .
5 He led him to the king , who fell into a furious passion , and said : ` Well , you have learned what it is to be very near death , and now will you say `` To my good health '' ? '
6 But the shepherd answered : ' I am not afraid of ten deaths !
7 I will only say it if I may have the princess for my wife . '
8 ` Then go to your death , ' cried the king ; and ordered him to be thrown into the den with the wild boars .
9 The wild boars had not been fed for a week , and when the shepherd was thrust into their don they rushed at him to tear him to pieces .
10 But the shepherd took a little flute out of the sleeve of his jacket and began to play a merry tune , on which the wild boars first of all shrank shyly away , and then got up on their hind legs and danced gaily .
11 The shepherd would have given anything to be able to laugh , they looked so funny ; but he dared not stop playing , for he knew well enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear him to pieces .
12 His eyes were of no use to him here , for he could not have stared ten wild boars in the face at once ; so he kept on playing , and the wild boars danced very slowly , as if in a minuet , then by degrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and turn quickly enough , and ended by all falling over each other in a heap , quite exhausted and out of breath .
13 Then the shepherd ventured to laugh at last ; and he laughed so long and so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning , expecting to find only his bones , the tears were still running down his cheeks from laughter .
14 As soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before him ; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not torn the man to bits , and he said : ` Well , you have learned what it feels to be near ten deaths , now say `` To my good health ! '' '
15 But the shepherd broke in with , ' I do not fear a hundred deaths , and I will only say it if I may have the princess for my wife . '
16 ` Then go to a hundred deaths ! '
17 roared the king , and ordered the shepherd to be thrown down the deep vault of scythes .
18 The guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon , in the middle of which was a deep well with sharp scythes all round it .

8 The shepherd would have given anything to be able to laugh , they looked so funny ; but he dared not stop playing , for he knew well enough that the moment he stopped they would fall upon him and tear him to pieces .
9 His eyes were of no use to him here , for he could not have stared ten wild boars in the face at once ; so he kept on playing , and the wild boars danced very slowly , as if in a minuet , then by degrees he played faster and faster till they could hardly twist and turn quickly enough , and ended by all falling over each other in a heap , quite exhausted and out of breath .
10 Then the shepherd ventured to laugh at last ; and he laughed so long and so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning , expecting to find only his bones , the tears were still running down his cheeks from laughter .
11 As soon as the king was dressed the shepherd was again brought before him ; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not torn the man to bits , and he said : ` Well , you have learned what it feels to be near ten deaths , now say `` To my good health ! '' '
12 But the shepherd broke in with , ' I do not fear a hundred deaths , and I will only say it if I may have the princess for my wife . '
13 ` Then go to a hundred deaths ! '
14 roared the king , and ordered the shepherd to be thrown down the deep vault of scythes .
15 The guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon , in the middle of which was a deep well with sharp scythes all round it .
16 At the bottom of the well was a little light by which one could see if anyone was thrown in whether he had fallen to the bottom .
17 When the shepherd was dragged to the dungeons he begged the guards to leave him alone a little while that he might look down into the pit of scythes ; perhaps he might after all make up his mind to say ` To your good health ' to the king .
18 So the guards left him alone and he stuck up his long stick near the well , hung his cloak round the stick and put his hat on the top .
19 He also hung his knapsack up inside the cloak so that it might seem to have some body within it .
20 When this was done he called out to the guards and said that he had considered the matter but after all he could not make up his mind to say what the king wished .
21 The guards came in , threw the hat and cloak , knapsack and stick all down the well together , watched to see how they put out the light at the bottom and came away , thinking that now there really was an end of the XXXXX .	shepherd		Lord|deaths|den|eyes|mind|shepherd|tune|vault|well|wife
