16 Her shrieks brought back the guards , but though they looked in all kinds of impossible places no man was to be seen , and so they told the princess .
17 ` He was here a moment ago -- I saw him with my own eyes , ' and the guards dared not contradict her , though they shook their heads and whispered to each other that the princess had gone mad on this subject , and saw a man in every table and chair .
18 And they made up their minds that -- let her scream as loudly as she might -- they would take no notice .
19 Now the princess saw clearly what they were thinking , and that in future her guards would give her no help , and would perhaps , besides , tell some stories about her to the king , who would shut her up in a lonely tower and prevent her walking in the gardens among her birds and flowers .
20 So when , for the third time , she beheld the prince standing before her , she did not scream but sat up in bed gazing at him in silent terror .
21 ` Do not be afraid , ' he said , ' I shall not hurt you ' ; and he began to praise her gardens , of which he had heard the servants speak , and the birds and flowers which she loved , till the XXXXX 's anger softened , and she answered him with gentle words .	princess		bed|bench|cupboards|curtains|hall|kinds|palace|princess|subject|time

3 cried she ; but when the guards rushed in there was only a bumble-bee buzzing about the room .
4 They looked under the bed , and behind the curtains , and into the cupboards , then came to the conclusion that the princess had had a bad dream , and bowed themselves out .
5 The door had scarcely closed on them than the bee disappeared , and a handsome youth stood in his place . '
6 I knew a man was hidden somewhere , ' cried the princess , and screamed more loudly than before .
7 Her shrieks brought back the guards , but though they looked in all kinds of impossible places no man was to be seen , and so they told the princess .
8 ` He was here a moment ago -- I saw him with my own eyes , ' and the guards dared not contradict her , though they shook their heads and whispered to each other that the princess had gone mad on this subject , and saw a man in every table and chair .
9 And they made up their minds that -- let her scream as loudly as she might -- they would take no notice .
10 Now the princess saw clearly what they were thinking , and that in future her guards would give her no help , and would perhaps , besides , tell some stories about her to the king , who would shut her up in a lonely tower and prevent her walking in the gardens among her birds and flowers .
11 So when , for the third time , she beheld the prince standing before her , she did not scream but sat up in bed gazing at him in silent terror .
12 ` Do not be afraid , ' he said , ' I shall not hurt you ' ; and he began to praise her gardens , of which he had heard the servants speak , and the birds and flowers which she loved , till the princess 's anger softened , and she answered him with gentle words .
13 Indeed , they soon became so friendly that she vowed she would marry no one else , and confided to him that in three days her father would be off to the wars , leaving his sword in her room .
14 If any man could find it and bring it to him he would receive her hand as a reward .
15 At this point a cock crew , and the youth jumped up hastily saying : ` Of course I shall ride with the king to the war , and if I do not return , take your violin every evening to the seashore and play on it , so that the very sea-kobolds who live at the bottom of the ocean may hear it and come to you . '
16 Just as the princess had foretold , in three days the king set out for the war with a large following , and among them was the young prince , who had presented himself at court as a young noble in search of adventures .
17 They had left the city many miles behind them , when the king suddenly discovered that he had forgotten his sword , and though all his attendants instantly offered theirs , he declared that he could fight with none but his own .

4 ` He was here a moment ago -- I saw him with my own eyes , ' and the guards dared not contradict her , though they shook their heads and whispered to each other that the princess had gone mad on this subject , and saw a man in every table and chair .
5 And they made up their minds that -- let her scream as loudly as she might -- they would take no notice .
6 Now the princess saw clearly what they were thinking , and that in future her guards would give her no help , and would perhaps , besides , tell some stories about her to the king , who would shut her up in a lonely tower and prevent her walking in the gardens among her birds and flowers .
7 So when , for the third time , she beheld the prince standing before her , she did not scream but sat up in bed gazing at him in silent terror .
8 ` Do not be afraid , ' he said , ' I shall not hurt you ' ; and he began to praise her gardens , of which he had heard the servants speak , and the birds and flowers which she loved , till the princess 's anger softened , and she answered him with gentle words .
9 Indeed , they soon became so friendly that she vowed she would marry no one else , and confided to him that in three days her father would be off to the wars , leaving his sword in her room .
10 If any man could find it and bring it to him he would receive her hand as a reward .
11 At this point a cock crew , and the youth jumped up hastily saying : ` Of course I shall ride with the king to the war , and if I do not return , take your violin every evening to the seashore and play on it , so that the very sea-kobolds who live at the bottom of the ocean may hear it and come to you . '
12 Just as the princess had foretold , in three days the king set out for the war with a large following , and among them was the young prince , who had presented himself at court as a young noble in search of adventures .
13 They had left the city many miles behind them , when the king suddenly discovered that he had forgotten his sword , and though all his attendants instantly offered theirs , he declared that he could fight with none but his own .
14 ` The first man who brings it to me from my daughter 's room , ' cried he , ` shall not only have her to wife , but after my death shall reign in my stead . '
15 At this the Red Knight , the young prince , and several more turned their horses to ride as fast as the wind back to the palace .
16 But suddenly a better plan entered the prince 's head , and , letting the others pass him , he took his precious parcel from his breast and wished himself a lion .
17 Then on he bounded , uttering such dreadful roars that the horses were frightened and grew unmanageable , and he easily outstripped them , and soon reached the gates of the palace .
18 Here he hastily changed himself into a bee , and flew straight into the princess 's room , where he became a man again .
19 She showed him where the sword hung concealed behind a curtain , and he took it down , saying as he did so : ` Be sure not to forget what you have promised to do . '
20 The princess made no reply , but smiled sweetly , and slipping a golden ring from her finger she broke it in two and held half out silently to the prince , while the other half she put in her own pocket .
21 He kissed it , and ran down the stairs bearing the XXXXX with him .	sword		curtain|flowers|guards|minds|one|prince|princess|servants|sword|tower

7 But suddenly a better plan entered the prince 's head , and , letting the others pass him , he took his precious parcel from his breast and wished himself a lion .
8 Then on he bounded , uttering such dreadful roars that the horses were frightened and grew unmanageable , and he easily outstripped them , and soon reached the gates of the palace .
9 Here he hastily changed himself into a bee , and flew straight into the princess 's room , where he became a man again .
10 She showed him where the sword hung concealed behind a curtain , and he took it down , saying as he did so : ` Be sure not to forget what you have promised to do . '
11 The princess made no reply , but smiled sweetly , and slipping a golden ring from her finger she broke it in two and held half out silently to the prince , while the other half she put in her own pocket .
12 He kissed it , and ran down the stairs bearing the sword with him .
13 Some way off he met the Red Knight and the rest , and the Red Knight at first tried to take the sword from him by force .

15 This soon came , for the day was hot and the prince was thirsty .
16 Perceiving a little stream that ran into the sea , he turned aside , and , unbuckling the sword , flung himself on the ground for a long drink .
17 Unluckily , the mermaid happened at that moment to be floating on the water not very far off , and knew he was the boy who had been given her before he was born .
18 So she floated gently in to where he was lying , she seized him by the arm , and the waves closed over them both .
19 Hardly had they disappeared , when the Red Knight stole cautiously up , and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the king 's sword on the bank .
20 He wondered what had become of the youth , who an hour before had guarded his treasure so fiercely ; but , after all , that was no affair of his !

17 But when the princess from her window saw that her betrothed was not among the attendants riding behind her father , her heart sank , for she knew that some evil must have befallen him , and she feared the Red Knight .
18 She had long ago learned how clever and how wicked he was , and something whispered to her that it was he who would gain the credit of having carried back the sword , and would claim her as his bride , though he had never even entered her chamber .

5 The princess made no reply , but smiled sweetly , and slipping a golden ring from her finger she broke it in two and held half out silently to the prince , while the other half she put in her own pocket .

2 So she floated gently in to where he was lying , she seized him by the arm , and the waves closed over them both .
3 Hardly had they disappeared , when the Red Knight stole cautiously up , and could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the king 's sword on the bank .
4 He wondered what had become of the youth , who an hour before had guarded his treasure so fiercely ; but , after all , that was no affair of his !
5 So , fastening the sword to his belt , he carried it to the king .
6 The war was soon over , and the king returned to his people , who welcomed him with shouts of joy .
7 But when the princess from her window saw that her betrothed was not among the attendants riding behind her father , her heart sank , for she knew that some evil must have befallen him , and she feared the Red Knight .
8 She had long ago learned how clever and how wicked he was , and something whispered to her that it was he who would gain the credit of having carried back the sword , and would claim her as his bride , though he had never even entered her chamber .
9 And she could do nothing ; for although the king loved her , he never let her stand in the way of his plans .
10 The poor princess was only too right , and everything came to pass exactly as she had foreseen it .
11 The king told her that the Red Knight had won her fairly , and that the wedding would take place next day , and there would be a great feast after it .
12 In those days feasts were much longer and more splendid than they are now ; and it was growing dark when the princess , tired out with all she had gone through , stole up to her own room for a little quiet .
13 But the moon was shining so brightly over the sea that it seemed to draw her towards it , and taking her violin under her arm , she crept down to the shore .
14 ` Listen !
15 listen !
16 said the mermaid to the prince , who was lying stretched on a bed of seaweeds at the bottom of the sea .
17 ` Listen !

17 One day Pivi and Kabo thought that they would make slings , and practice slinging , as the people of the island still do .
18 So they went to a banyan tree , and stripped the bark to make strings for their slings , and next they repaired to the river bank to find stones .

3 ` Now become a bear , ' said she ; and a bear advanced panting and stretching out his arms to the Red Knight , who shrank behind the princess .
4 By this time some of the guests had regained their courage , and returned as far as the door , thinking that if it was safe for the princess perhaps it was safe for them .
5 The king , who was braver than they , and felt it needful to set them a good example besides , had never left his seat , and when at a new command of the princess the bear once more turned into a man , he was silent from astonishment , and a suspicion of the truth began to dawn on him .
6 ` Was it he who fetched the sword ? '
7 asked the king .
8 ` Yes , it was , ' answered the princess ; and she told him the whole story , and how she had broken her gold ring and given him half of it .
9 And the prince took out his half of the ring , and the princess took out hers , and they fitted exactly .
10 Next day the Red Knight was hanged , as he richly deserved , and there was a new marriage feast for the prince and princess .

12 Pivi and Kabo When birds were men , and men were birds , Pivi and Kabo lived in an island far away , called New Claledonia .
13 Pivi was a cheery little bird that chirps at sunset ; Kabo was an ugly black fowl that croaks in the darkness .
14 One day Pivi and Kabo thought that they would make slings , and practice slinging , as the people of the island still do .
15 So they went to a banyan tree , and stripped the bark to make strings for their slings , and next they repaired to the river bank to find stones .
16 Kabo stood on the bank of the river , and Pivi went into the water .
17 The game was for Kabo to sling at Pivi , and for Pivi to dodge the stones , if he could .
18 For some time he dodged them cleverly , but at last a stone from Kabo 's sling hit poor Pivi on the leg and broke it .
19 Down went Pivi into the stream , and floated along it , till he floated into a big hollow bamboo , which a woman used for washing her sweet potatoes .

6 During the winter , it was all night except for an hour or so about noon , when the darkness seemed a little less dark , and then they used to see which of them could tempt her out for a sleigh ride with the Northern Lights flashing above them , or which could persuade her to come to a dance in some neighbouring barn .
7 But when the spring began , and the light grew longer , the hearts of the villagers leapt at the sight of the sun , and a day was fixed for the boats to be brought out , and the great nets to be spread in the bays of some islands that lay a few miles to the north .
8 Everybody went on this expedition , and the two young men and the girl went with them .
9 They all sailed merrily across the sea chattering like a flock of magpies , or singing their favourite songs .
10 And when they reached the shore , what an unpacking there was !
11 For this was a noted fishing ground , and here they would live , in little wooden huts , till autumn and bad weather came round again .
12 The maiden and the two young men happened to share the same hut with some friends , and fished daily from the same boat .
13 And as time went on , one of the youths remarked that the girl took less notice of him than she did of his companion .
14 At first he tried to think that he was dreaming , and for a long while he kept his eyes shut very tight to what he did not want to see , but in spite of his efforts , the truth managed to wriggle through , and then the young man gave up trying to deceive himself , and set about finding some way to get the better of his rival .
15 The plan that he hit upon could not be carried out for some months ; but the longer the young man thought of it , the more pleased he was with it , so he made no sign of his feelings , and waited patiently till the moment came .
16 This was the very day that they were all going to leave the islands , and sail back to the mainland for the winter .
17 In the bustle and hurry of departure , the cunning fisherman contrived that their boat should be the last to put off , and when everything was ready , and the sails about to be set , he suddenly called out : ` Oh , dear , what shall I do !
18 I have left my best knife behind in the hut .
19 Run , like a good fellow , and get it for me , while I raise the anchor and loosen the tiller . '
20 Not thinking any harm , the youth jumped back on shore and made his way up the steep hank .
21 At the door of the XXXXX he stopped and looked back , then started and gazed in horror .	hut		bays|bustle|friends|harm|hut|mainland|nets|rival|tiller|way

14 The evening before , the youth went down to the rocks and into the copse , collecting all the drift wood the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down , and he piled it up in a great stack outside the door , so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day .
15 As soon as his task was done , he paused and looked out towards the mainland , thinking of Christmas Eve last year , and the merry dance they had had .
16 The night was still and cold , and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast , when , suddenly , he noticed a boat , which seemed steering straight for the island .
17 At first he could hardly stand for joy , the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful ; but as the boat drew near there was something , he could not tell what , that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life , and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours .
18 Then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack , and waited for what might happen next .
19 The strange folk one by one jumped on to the rocks , each bearing a load of something that they wanted .
20 Among the women he remarked two young girls , more beautiful and better dressed than any of the rest , carrying between them two great baskets full of provisions .
21 The young man peeped out cautiously to see what all this crowd could be doing inside the tiny XXXXX , but in a moment he drew back again , as the girls returned , and looked about as if they wanted to find out what sort of a place the island was .	hut		beings|fellow|folk|girls|hut|nothing|people|pocket|winter|women

1 This was the very day that they were all going to leave the islands , and sail back to the mainland for the winter .
2 In the bustle and hurry of departure , the cunning fisherman contrived that their boat should be the last to put off , and when everything was ready , and the sails about to be set , he suddenly called out : ` Oh , dear , what shall I do !
3 I have left my best knife behind in the hut .
4 Run , like a good fellow , and get it for me , while I raise the anchor and loosen the tiller . '
5 Not thinking any harm , the youth jumped back on shore and made his way up the steep hank .
6 At the door of the hut he stopped and looked back , then started and gazed in horror .
7 The head of the boat stood out to sea , and he was left alone on the island .
8 Yes , there was no doubt of it -- he was quite alone ; and he had nothing to help him except the knife which his comrade had purposely dropped on the ledge of the window .
9 For some minutes he was too stunned by the treachery of his friend to think about anything at all , but after a while he shook himself awake , and determined that he would manage to keep alive somehow , if it were only to revenge himself .
10 So he put the knife in his pocket and went off to a part of the island which was not so bare as the rest , and had a small grove of trees .
11 From one of these he cut himself a bow , which he strung with a piece of cord that had been left lying about the huts .

9 The night was still and cold , and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast , when , suddenly , he noticed a boat , which seemed steering straight for the island .
10 At first he could hardly stand for joy , the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful ; but as the boat drew near there was something , he could not tell what , that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life , and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours .
11 Then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack , and waited for what might happen next .
12 The strange folk one by one jumped on to the rocks , each bearing a load of something that they wanted .
13 Among the women he remarked two young girls , more beautiful and better dressed than any of the rest , carrying between them two great baskets full of provisions .
14 The young man peeped out cautiously to see what all this crowd could be doing inside the tiny hut , but in a moment he drew back again , as the girls returned , and looked about as if they wanted to find out what sort of a place the island was .
15 Their sharp eyes soon discovered the form of a man crouching behind the bundles of sticks , and at first they felt a little frightened , and started as if they would run away .
16 But the youth remained so still , that they took courage and laughed gaily to each other .
17 ` What a strange creature , let us try what he is made of , ' said one , and she stooped down and gave him a pinch .
18 Now the young man had a pin sticking in the sleeve of his jacket , and the moment the girl 's hand touched him she pricked it so sharply that the blood came .
19 The girl screamed so loudly that the people all ran out of their huts to see what was the matter .
20 But directly they caught sight of the man they turned and fled in the other direction , and picking up the goods they had brought with them scampered as fast as they could down to the shore .
21 In an instant , boat , XXXXX , and goods had vanished completely .	people		Lights|beings|boats|direction|help|life|people|sea|task|youth

1 Yes , there was no doubt of it -- he was quite alone ; and he had nothing to help him except the knife which his comrade had purposely dropped on the ledge of the window .
2 For some minutes he was too stunned by the treachery of his friend to think about anything at all , but after a while he shook himself awake , and determined that he would manage to keep alive somehow , if it were only to revenge himself .
3 So he put the knife in his pocket and went off to a part of the island which was not so bare as the rest , and had a small grove of trees .
4 From one of these he cut himself a bow , which he strung with a piece of cord that had been left lying about the huts .
5 When this was ready the young man ran down to the shore and shot one or two sea-birds , which he plucked and cooked for supper .
6 In this way the months slipped by , and Christmas came round again .

2 ` Do not be anxious about that , ' said the girl ; ` if you will only marry me all will be well .

4 Then the young man gave her his promise to make her his wife , and the girl fulfilled her part of the bargain , and food was plentiful on the island all through the long winter months , though he never knew how it got there .

11 In a tiny bay , on the opposite side of the island they found the very thing , which seemed to have been made on purpose for them ; and as they were tired with their long walk , they laid themselves down on a bank of moss among some birches and prepared to have a good night 's rest , so as to be fresh for work next day .

15 But as he was a little afraid of his wife , who knew so much more than he , he asked no questions .
16 This night also he was awakened by the same sounds as before , and in the morning they found , near the stream , the most beautiful cow-house that ever was seen , with stalls and milk-pails and stools all complete , indeed , everything that a cow-house could possibly want , except the cows .
17 Then the girl bade him measure out the ground for a storehouse , and this , she said , might be as large as he pleased ; and when the storehouse was ready she proposed that they should set off to pay her parents a visit .
18 The old people welcomed them heartily , and summoned their neighbours , for many miles round , to a great feast in their honour .
19 In fact , for several weeks there was no work done on the farm at all ; and at length the young man and his wife grew tired of so much play , and declared that they must return to their own home .
20 But , before they started on the journey , the wife whispered to her husband : ` Take care to jump over the threshold as quick as you can , or it will be the worse for you . '
21 The young XXXXX listened to her words , and sprang over the threshold like an arrow from a bow ; and it was well he did , for , no sooner was he on the other side , than his father-in-law threw a great hammer at him , which would have broken both his legs , if it had only touched them .	man		banks|bid|care|cherries|doors|dreams|length|man|night|world

1 ` Where are we to go now ? '
2 asked the girl , one day , when the sun seemed brighter and the wind softer than usual . '
3 I do not care where I go , ' answered the young man ; ` what do you think ? '
4 The girl replied that she would like to go somewhere right at the other end of the island , and build a house , far away from the huts of the fishing-folk .
5 And he consented , and that very day they set off in search of a sheltered spot on the banks of a stream , so that it would be easy to get water .
6 In a tiny bay , on the opposite side of the island they found the very thing , which seemed to have been made on purpose for them ; and as they were tired with their long walk , they laid themselves down on a bank of moss among some birches and prepared to have a good night 's rest , so as to be fresh for work next day .
7 But before she went to sleep the girl turned to her husband , and said : ` If in your dreams you fancy that you hear strange noises , be sure you do not stir , or get up to see what it is . '
8 ` Oh , it is not likely we shall hear any noises in such a quiet place , ' answered he , and fell sound asleep .
9 Suddenly he was awakened by a great clatter about his ears , as if all the workmen in the world were sawing and hammering and building close to him .
10 He was just going to spring up and go to see what it meant , when he luckily remembered his wife 's words and lay still .
11 But the time till morning seemed very long , and with the first ray of sun they both rose , and pushed aside the branches of the birch trees .
12 There , in the very place they had chosen , stood a beautiful house -- doors and windows , and everything all complete !
