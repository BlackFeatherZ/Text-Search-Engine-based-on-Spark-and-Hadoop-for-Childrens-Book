13 PRINCE HYACINTH AND THE DEAR LITTLE PRINCESS Once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a princess , but she could not marry anyone , because she was under an enchantment .

16 Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat 's tail is the man she is destined to marry . ''
17 The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult , and he left the Fairy , determined to grind the cat 's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all .

4 PRINCE HYACINTH AND THE DEAR LITTLE PRINCESS Once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a princess , but she could not marry anyone , because she was under an enchantment .
5 So the King set out to seek a fairy , and asked what he could do to win the Princess 's love .
6 The Fairy said to him : `` You know that the Princess has a great cat which she is very fond of .
7 Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat 's tail is the man she is destined to marry . ''
8 The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult , and he left the Fairy , determined to grind the cat 's tail to powder rather than not tread on it at all .
9 You may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the Princess , and puss , as usual , marched in before him , arching his back .
10 The King took a long step , and quite thought he had the tail under his foot , but the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air .
11 And so it went on for eight days , till the King began to think that this fatal tail must be full of quicksilver -- it was never still for a moment .
12 At last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out .
13 So the King , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily .
14 With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the King , said : `` You shall marry the Princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but I will have my revenge .
15 You shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what I have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again . ''
16 Though the King was horribly afraid of the enchanter , he could not help laughing at this threat .
17 `` If my son has such a long nose as that , '' he said to himself , `` he must always see it or feel it ; at least , if he is not blind or without hands . ''
18 But , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking , but went to seek the Princess , who very soon consented to marry him .
19 But after all , they had not been married very long when the King died , and the Queen had nothing left to care for but her little son , who was called Hyacinth .
20 The little Prince had large blue eyes , the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth , but , alas !
21 his XXXXX was so enormous that it covered half his face .	nose		Fairy|PRINCE|cat|enchantment|hands|love|nose|nothing|threat|world

9 But , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking , but went to seek the Princess , who very soon consented to marry him .
10 But after all , they had not been married very long when the King died , and the Queen had nothing left to care for but her little son , who was called Hyacinth .
11 The little Prince had large blue eyes , the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth , but , alas !
12 his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face .
13 The Queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose , but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked ; that it was a Roman nose , and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose .
14 The Queen , who was devoted to her baby , was pleased with what they told her , and when she looked at Hyacinth again , his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large .
15 The Prince was brought up with great care ; and , as soon as he could speak , they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses .
16 No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own , and the courtiers , to get into favor with the Queen , took to pulling their babies ' noses several times every day to make them grow long .
17 But , do what they would , they were nothing by comparison with the Prince 's .
18 When he grew sensible he learned history ; and whenever any great prince or beautiful princess was spoken of , his teachers took care to tell him that they had long noses .
19 His room was hung with pictures , all of people with very large noses ; and the Prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty , that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter !
20 When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen thought it was time that he should be married , so she commanded that the portraits of several princesses should be brought for him to see , and among the others was a picture of the Dear Little Princess !
21 Now , she was the daughter of a great king , and would some day possess several kingdoms herself ; but Prince Hyacinth had not a thought to spare for anything of that sort , he was so much struck with her XXXXX .	beauty		babies|beauty|cat|eyes|face|ladies|moment|people|princess|world

2 At last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out .
3 So the King , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily .
4 With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the King , said : `` You shall marry the Princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but I will have my revenge .
5 You shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what I have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again . ''

21 The others , taking warning from this , learned to think twice before they spoke , and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that , though it was quite true that no XXXXX could be worth anything unless he had a long nose , still , a woman 's beauty was a different thing ; and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a `` tip-tilted '' nose !	man		account|daughter|hers|man|nothing|others|people|pictures|room|time

18 The others , taking warning from this , learned to think twice before they spoke , and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that , though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose , still , a woman 's beauty was a different thing ; and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a `` tip-tilted '' nose !
19 The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news , and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in marriage .
20 The King , her father , gave his consent ; and Prince Hyacinth , who , in his anxiety to see the Princess , had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when , to the horror of all who stood by , the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning , and , snatching up the Dear Little Princess , whirled her away out of their sight !

12 The others , taking warning from this , learned to think twice before they spoke , and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that , though it was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a long nose , still , a woman 's beauty was a different thing ; and he knew a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a `` tip-tilted '' nose !
13 The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news , and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in marriage .

4 The Prince was left quite unconsolable , and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again , and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him , he mounted his horse and rode sadly away , letting the animal choose his own path .
5 So it happened that he came presently to a great plain , across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house , and horse and rider were terribly hungry , when , as the night fell , the Prince caught sight of a light , which seemed to shine from a cavern .
6 He rode up to it , and saw a little old woman , who appeared to be at least a hundred years old .
7 She put on her spectacles to look at Prince Hyacinth , but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short .
8 The Prince and the Fairy -LRB- for that was who she was -RRB- had no sooner looked at one another than they went into fits of laughter , and cried at the same moment , `` Oh , what a funny nose ! ''
9 `` Not so funny as your own , '' said Prince Hyacinth to the Fairy ; `` but , madam , I beg you to leave the consideration of our noses -- such as they are -- and to be good enough to give me something to eat , for I am starving , and so is my poor horse . ''
10 `` With all my heart , '' said the Fairy .
11 `` Though your nose is so ridiculous you are , nevertheless , the son of my best friend .

19 The White Bear gave her a silver bell , and told her that when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell , and what she wanted would appear .
20 So after she had eaten , and night was drawing near , she grew sleepy after her journey , and thought she would like to go to bed .

9 She said no , and would not hear of it ; so the man went out again , and settled with the White Bear that he should come again next Thursday evening , and get her answer .
10 Then the man persuaded her , and talked so much to her about the wealth that they would have , and what a good thing it would be for herself , that at last she made up her mind to go , and washed and mended all her rags , made herself as smart as she could , and held herself in readiness to set out .
11 Little enough had she to take away with her .
12 Next Thursday evening the White Bear came to fetch her .
13 She seated herself on his back with her bundle , and thus they departed .
14 When they had gone a great part of the way , the White Bear said : `` Are you afraid ? ''
15 `` No , that I am not , '' said she .
16 `` Keep tight hold of my fur , and then there is no danger , '' said he .
17 And thus she rode far , far away , until they came to a great mountain .
18 Then the White Bear knocked on it , and a door opened , and they went into a castle where there were many brilliantly lighted rooms which shone with gold and silver , likewise a large hall in which there was a well-spread table , and it was so magnificent that it would be hard to make anyone understand how splendid it was .
19 The White Bear gave her a silver bell , and told her that when she needed anything she had but to ring this bell , and what she wanted would appear .
20 So after she had eaten , and night was drawing near , she grew sleepy after her journey , and thought she would like to go to bed .
21 She rang the bell , and scarcely had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready made for her , which was as pretty as XXXXX could wish to sleep in .	anyone		anyone|bounds|hall|hold|mind|mountain|objection|rags|table|thing

6 Then the White Bear asked what it was that she wanted , and she told him that it was so dull there in the mountain , and that she had to go about all alone , and that in her parents ' house at home there were all her brothers and sisters , and it was because she could not go to them that she was so sorrowful .
7 `` There might be a cure for that , '' said the White Bear , `` if you would but promise me never to talk with your mother alone , but only when the others are there too ; for she will take hold of your hand , '' he said , `` and will want to lead you into a room to talk with you alone ; but that you must by no means do , or you will bring great misery on both of us . ''
8 So one Sunday the White Bear came and said that they could now set out to see her father and mother , and they journeyed thither , she sitting on his back , and they went a long , long way , and it took a long , long time ; but at last they came to a large white farmhouse , and her brothers and sisters were running about outside it , playing , and it was so pretty that it was a pleasure to look at it .
9 `` Your parents dwell here now , '' said the White Bear ; `` but do not forget what I said to you , or you will do much harm both to yourself and me . ''
10 `` No , indeed , '' said she , `` I shall never forget ; '' and as soon as she was at home the White Bear turned round and went back again .
11 There were such rejoicings when she went in to her parents that it seemed as if they would never come to an end .
12 Everyone thought that he could never be sufficiently grateful to her for all she had done for them all .
13 Now they had everything that they wanted , and everything was as good as it could be .
14 They all asked her how she was getting on where she was .
15 All was well with her too , she said ; and she had everything that she could want .
16 What other answers she gave I can not say , but I am pretty sure that they did not learn much from her .
17 But in the afternoon , after they had dined at midday , all happened just as the White Bear had said .
18 Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber .
19 But she remembered what the White Bear had said , and would on no account go .
20 `` What we have to say can be said at any time , '' she answered .
21 But somehow or other her XXXXX at last persuaded her , and she was forced to tell the whole story .	mother		bell|chamber|cure|father|harm|light|mother|mountain|parents|time

1 She rang the bell , and scarcely had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed stood ready made for her , which was as pretty as anyone could wish to sleep in .
2 It had pillows of silk , and curtains of silk fringed with gold , and everything that was in the room was of gold or silver , but when she had lain down and put out the light a man came and lay down beside her , and behold it was the White Bear , who cast off the form of a beast during the night .
3 She never saw him , however , for he always came after she had put out her light , and went away before daylight appeared .

16 `` Then , if you have done what your mother wished , '' said he , `` you have brought great misery on both of us . ''
17 `` No , '' she said , `` I have not done anything at all . ''
18 So when she had reached home and had gone to bed it was just the same as it had been before , and a man came and lay down beside her , and late at night , when she could hear that he was sleeping , she got up and kindled a light , lit her candle , let her light shine on him , and saw him , and he was the handsomest prince that eyes had ever beheld , and she loved him so much that it seemed to her that she must die if she did not kiss him that very moment .
19 So she did kiss him ; but while she was doing it she let three drops of hot tallow fall upon his shirt , and he awoke .

1 But in the afternoon , after they had dined at midday , all happened just as the White Bear had said .
2 Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber .
3 But she remembered what the White Bear had said , and would on no account go .
4 `` What we have to say can be said at any time , '' she answered .
5 But somehow or other her mother at last persuaded her , and she was forced to tell the whole story .
6 So she told how every night a man came and lay down beside her when the lights were all put out , and how she never saw him , because he always went away before it grew light in the morning , and how she continually went about in sadness , thinking how happy she would be if she could but see him , and how all day long she had to go about alone , and it was so dull and solitary .
7 `` Oh ! ''
8 cried the mother , in horror , `` you are very likely sleeping with a troll !
9 But I will teach you a way to see him .
10 You shall have a bit of one of my candles , which you can take away with you hidden in your breast .
11 Look at him with that when he is asleep , but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him . ''
12 So she took the candle , and hid it in her breast , and when evening drew near the White Bear came to fetch her away .

8 So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes , and wept till she was weary , she set out on her way , and thus she walked for many and many a long day , until at last she came to a great mountain .
9 Outside it an aged woman was sitting , playing with a golden apple .
10 The girl asked her if she knew the way to the Prince who lived with his stepmother in the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon , and who was to marry a princess with a nose which was three ells long .
11 `` How do you happen to know about him ? ''
12 inquired the old woman ; `` maybe you are she who ought to have had him . ''
13 `` Yes , indeed , I am , '' she said .
14 `` So it is you , then ? ''
15 said the old woman ; `` I know nothing about him but that he dwells in a castle which is east of the sun and west of the moon .
16 You will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you get to it at all ; but you shall have the loan of my horse , and then you can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine : perhaps she can tell you about him .
17 When you have got there you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again ; but you may take the golden apple with you . ''
18 So the girl seated herself on the horse , and rode for a long , long way , and at last she came to the mountain , where an aged woman was sitting outside with a gold carding-comb .
19 The girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon ; but she said what the first old woman had said : `` I know nothing about it , but that it is east of the sun and west of the moon , and that you will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you get there at all ; but you shall have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me : perhaps she may know where the castle is , and when you have got to her you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again .

20 Then she gave her the gold carding-comb , for it might , perhaps , be of use to her , she said .
21 So the girl seated herself on the horse , and rode a wearisome long way onward again , and after a very long time she came to a great XXXXX , where an aged woman was sitting , spinning at a golden spinning-wheel .	mountain		apple|castle|girl|horse|mountain|side|time|way|woman|wood

3 `` Can you tell me the way then , and I will seek you -- that I may surely be allowed to do ! ''
4 `` Yes , you may do that , '' said he ; `` but there is no way thither .

8 `` Yes , indeed , I am , '' she said .
9 `` So it is you , then ? ''

11 You will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you get to it at all ; but you shall have the loan of my horse , and then you can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine : perhaps she can tell you about him .

13 So the girl seated herself on the horse , and rode for a long , long way , and at last she came to the mountain , where an aged woman was sitting outside with a gold carding-comb .
14 The girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon ; but she said what the first old woman had said : `` I know nothing about it , but that it is east of the sun and west of the moon , and that you will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you get there at all ; but you shall have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me : perhaps she may know where the castle is , and when you have got to her you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again .

16 So the girl seated herself on the horse , and rode a wearisome long way onward again , and after a very long time she came to a great mountain , where an aged woman was sitting , spinning at a golden spinning-wheel .

11 Then she gave her the gold carding-comb , for it might , perhaps , be of use to her , she said .
12 So the girl seated herself on the horse , and rode a wearisome long way onward again , and after a very long time she came to a great mountain , where an aged woman was sitting , spinning at a golden spinning-wheel .
13 Of this woman , too , she inquired if she knew the way to the Prince , and where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon .
14 But it was only the same thing once again .
15 `` Maybe it was you who should have had the Prince , '' said the old woman .
16 `` Yes , indeed , I should have been the one , '' said the girl .
17 But this old crone knew the way no better than the others -- it was east of the sun and west of the moon , she knew that , `` and you will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you get to it at all , '' she said ; `` but you may have the loan of my horse , and I think you had better ride to the East Wind , and ask him : perhaps he may know where the castle is , and will blow you thither .
18 But when you have got to him you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear , and he will come home again . ''
19 And then she gave her the golden spinning-wheel , saying : `` Perhaps you may find that you have a use for it . ''
20 The girl had to ride for a great many days , and for a long and wearisome time , before she got there ; but at last she did arrive , and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon .
21 `` Well , '' said the East Wind , `` I have heard tell of the Prince , and of his castle , but I do not know the XXXXX to it , for I have never blown so far ; but , if you like , I will go with you to my brother the West Wind : he may know that , for he is much stronger than I am .	way		castle|ear|girl|sun|thing|time|use|way|west|woman

1 `` Yes , indeed , I am , '' she said .
2 `` So it is you , then ? ''
3 said the old woman ; `` I know nothing about him but that he dwells in a castle which is east of the sun and west of the moon .
4 You will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you get to it at all ; but you shall have the loan of my horse , and then you can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine : perhaps she can tell you about him .
5 When you have got there you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again ; but you may take the golden apple with you . ''
6 So the girl seated herself on the horse , and rode for a long , long way , and at last she came to the mountain , where an aged woman was sitting outside with a gold carding-comb .
7 The girl asked her if she knew the way to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon ; but she said what the first old woman had said : `` I know nothing about it , but that it is east of the sun and west of the moon , and that you will be a long time in getting to it , if ever you get there at all ; but you shall have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me : perhaps she may know where the castle is , and when you have got to her you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again .

19 You may sit on my back , and then I can carry you there . ''
20 So she seated herself on his back , and they did go so swiftly !
21 When they got there , the East Wind went in and said that the XXXXX whom he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince up at the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon , and that now she was traveling about to find him again , so he had come there with her , and would like to hear if the West Wind knew whereabout the castle was .	girl		girl|home|loan|mountain|nothing|sun|time|use|way|west
