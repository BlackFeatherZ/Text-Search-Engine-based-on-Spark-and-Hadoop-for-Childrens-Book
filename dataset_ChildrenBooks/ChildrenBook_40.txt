16 When they had gone some distance on the road home , the girl turned to her husband and said : 'Till you step inside the house , be sure you do not look back , whatever you may hear or see . '

18 As he laid his hand upon the door he thought he was safe , and turned to look .
19 There , sure enough , was a vast herd of cattle , which had been sent after him by his father-in-law when he found that his daughter had been cleverer than he .
20 Half of the herd were already through the fence and cropping the grass on the banks of the stream , but half still remained outside and faded into nothing , even as he watched them .

1 But before she went to sleep the girl turned to her husband , and said : ` If in your dreams you fancy that you hear strange noises , be sure you do not stir , or get up to see what it is . '
2 ` Oh , it is not likely we shall hear any noises in such a quiet place , ' answered he , and fell sound asleep .
3 Suddenly he was awakened by a great clatter about his ears , as if all the workmen in the world were sawing and hammering and building close to him .
4 He was just going to spring up and go to see what it meant , when he luckily remembered his wife 's words and lay still .
5 But the time till morning seemed very long , and with the first ray of sun they both rose , and pushed aside the branches of the birch trees .
6 There , in the very place they had chosen , stood a beautiful house -- doors and windows , and everything all complete !
7 ` Now you must fix on a spot for your cow-stalls , ' said the girl , when they had breakfasted off wild cherries ; ` and take care it is the proper size , neither too large nor too small . '
8 And the husband did as he was bid , though he wondered what use a cow-house could be , as they had no cows to put in it .
9 But as he was a little afraid of his wife , who knew so much more than he , he asked no questions .
10 This night also he was awakened by the same sounds as before , and in the morning they found , near the stream , the most beautiful cow-house that ever was seen , with stalls and milk-pails and stools all complete , indeed , everything that a cow-house could possibly want , except the cows .
11 Then the girl bade him measure out the ground for a storehouse , and this , she said , might be as large as he pleased ; and when the storehouse was ready she proposed that they should set off to pay her parents a visit .
12 The old people welcomed them heartily , and summoned their neighbours , for many miles round , to a great feast in their honour .
13 In fact , for several weeks there was no work done on the farm at all ; and at length the young man and his wife grew tired of so much play , and declared that they must return to their own home .

13 The first to start on the morning of the wedding-day was the bear , who always liked to be punctual ; and , besides , he had a long way to go , and his hair , being so thick and rough , needed a good brushing before it was fit to be seen at a party .
14 However , he took care to awaken very early , and set off down the road with a light heart .
15 Before he had walked very far he met a boy who came whistling along , hitting at the tops of the flowers with a stick .
16 ` Where are you going ? '
17 said he , looking at the bear in surprise , for he was an old acquaintance , and not generally so smart .
18 ` Oh , just to the miller 's marriage , ' answered the bear carelessly .
19 ` Of course , I would much rather stay at home , but the miller was so anxious I should be there that I really could not refuse . '
20 ` Do n't go , do n't go ! '

1 There , sure enough , was a vast herd of cattle , which had been sent after him by his father-in-law when he found that his daughter had been cleverer than he .
2 Half of the herd were already through the fence and cropping the grass on the banks of the stream , but half still remained outside and faded into nothing , even as he watched them .
3 However , enough cattle were left to make the young man rich , and he and his wife lived happily together , except that every now and then the girl vanished from his sight , and never told him where she had been .
4 For a long time he kept silence about it ; but one day , when he had been complaining of her absence , she said to him : ` Dear husband , I am bound to go , even against my will , and there is only one way to stop me .
5 Drive a nail into the threshold , and then I can never pass in or out . '

2 ` What is the matter ? '
3 asked he .
4 ` You do n't know what you are doing , ' said the boy .
5 ` If once you go there you will never gallop through these woods any more .
6 You are stronger than many men , but they will catch you and put ropes round you , and you will have to work and to serve them all the days of your life . '
7 The horse threw back his head at these words , and laughed scornfully .
8 ` Yes , I am stronger than many men , ' answered he , ` and all the ropes in the world would not hold me .
9 Let them bind me as fast as they will , I can always break loose , and return to the forest and freedom . '
10 And with this proud speech he gave a whisk of his long tail , and galloped away faster than before .
11 But when he reached the miller 's house everything happened as the boy had said .
12 While he was looking at the guests and thinking how much handsomer and stronger he was than any of them , a rope was suddenly flung over his head , and he was thrown down and a bit thrust between his teeth .
13 Then , in spite of his struggles , he was dragged to a stable , and shut up for several days without any food , till his spirit was broken and his coat had lost its gloss .
14 After that he was harnessed to a plough , and had plenty of time to remember all he had lost through not listening to the counsel of the boy .
15 When the horse had turned a deaf ear to his words the boy wandered idly along , sometimes gathering wild strawberries from a bank , and sometimes plucking wild cherries from a tree , till he reached a clearing in the middle of the forest .
16 Crossing this open space was a beautiful milk-white cow with a wreath of flowers round her neck .
17 ` Good-morning , ' she said pleasantly , as she came up to the place where the boy was standing .

1 After that he was harnessed to a plough , and had plenty of time to remember all he had lost through not listening to the counsel of the boy .
2 When the horse had turned a deaf ear to his words the boy wandered idly along , sometimes gathering wild strawberries from a bank , and sometimes plucking wild cherries from a tree , till he reached a clearing in the middle of the forest .
3 Crossing this open space was a beautiful milk-white cow with a wreath of flowers round her neck .
4 ` Good-morning , ' she said pleasantly , as she came up to the place where the boy was standing .
5 ` Good-morning , ' he returned .
6 ` Where are you going in such a hurry ? '
7 ` To the miller 's wedding ; I am rather late already , for the wreath took such a long time to make , so I ca n't stop . '
8 ` Do n't go , ' said the boy earnestly ; ' when once they have tasted your milk they will never let you leave them , and you will have to serve them all the days of your life . '
9 ` Oh , nonsense ; what do you know about it ? '
10 answered the cow , who always thought she was wiser than other people .
11 ` Why , I can run twice as fast as any of them !
12 I should like to see anybody try to keep me against my will . '
13 And , without even a polite bow , she went on her way , feeling very much offended .
14 But everything turned out just as the boy had said .
15 The company had all heard of the fame of the cow 's milk , and persuaded her to give them some , and then her doom was sealed .
16 A crowd gathered round her , and held her horns so that she could not use them , and , like the horse , she was shut in the stable , and only let out in the mornings , when a long rope was tied round her head , and she was fastened to a stake in a grassy meadow .

9 ` Your master bids you level the hill that stands in front of the sultan 's palace and in its place to make the most beautiful garden in the world . '
10 ` Tell my master he shall be obeyed , ' replied Ali ; ` it shall be done this moment . '
11 And the old woman went home and gave Ali 's message to the head .
12 Meanwhile the sultan was in his palace waiting till the fortieth day should dawn , and wondering that not one spadeful of earth should have been dug out of the hill .
13 ` If that old woman has been playing me a trick , ' thought he , ' I will hang her !
14 And I will put up a gallows to-morrow on the hill itself . '
15 But when to-morrow came there was no hill , and when the sultan opened his eyes he could not imagine why the room was so much lighter than usual , and what was the reason of the sweet smell of flowers that filled the air .
16 ` Can there be a fire ? '
17 he said to himself ; ` the sun never came in at this window before .
18 I must get up and see . '
19 So he rose and looked out , and underneath him flowers from every part of the world were blooming , and creepers of every colour hung in chains from tree to tree .
20 Then he remembered .
21 ` Certainly that old XXXXX 's son is a clever magician ! '	woman		bridge|city|flowers|garden|hill|instant|palace|part|trick|woman
