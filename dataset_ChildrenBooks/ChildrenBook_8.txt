18 He was above the common height for giants , and his whole face and body were seamed over with little red lines , crossing each other like tartan .
19 These were marks of encounters , in which he had been cut to bits and come together again ; for this was his peculiarity , which made him so dangerous .

3 It was as broad as a table-cloth , and the address was written in letters as long as a hoop-stick .
4 `` I seem to know that hand , '' said Ricardo ; `` but I thought the fingers which held the pen had long been cold in death . ''
5 He opened , with his sword , the enormous letter , which was couched in the following terms : `` The Giant as does not know when he has had enuf , presents his compliments to Prince Ricardo ; and I , having recovered from the effects of our little recent rally , will be happy to meet you in the old place for a return-match .
6 I not being handy with the pen , the Giant hopes you will excuse mistakes and bad writing . ''
7 Dick simply gazed with amazement .
8 `` If ever I thought an enemy was killed and done for , it was that Giant , '' said he .
9 `` Why , I made mere mince-collops of him ! ''
10 However , he could not refuse a challenge , not to speak of his duty to rid the world of so greedy and odious a tyrant .
11 Dick , therefore , took the usual things -LRB- which the king had secretly restored -RRB- , but first he tried them -- putting on the Cap of Darkness before the glass , in which he could not see himself .
12 On second thoughts , he considered it unfair to take the cap .

8 But the poor Princess Jaqueline !
9 To perform the feat of changing Dick into a bird she had , of course , according to all the laws of magic , to resume her own natural form !
10 There she stood , a beautiful , trembling maiden , her hands crossed on her bosom , entirely at the mercy of the Giant !
11 No sooner had Dick escaped than the monster began to collect himself ; and before Jaqueline could muster strength to run away or summon to her aid the lessons of the Fairy Paribanou , the Giant who never Knew when he had Enough was himself again .

16 Dick was rescued , that was all , and the Princess Jaqueline had sacrificed herself to her love for him .
17 The Giant picked himself up and pulled himself together , as we said , and then approached Jaqueline in a very civil way , for a person of his breeding , head in hand .
18 `` Let me introduce myself , '' he said , and mentioned his name and titles .

18 But as soon as she was in the funnel , the whirlpool of air always sucking down and down , was too strong for her wings .
19 She was a prisoner in this great gleaming hall , ending in black nothingness .
20 So she resumed her usual form , and walking to the edge of the darkness , found that it was not empty air , but something black , soft , and strong -- something living .
21 It had no XXXXX or shape , or none that she could make out ; but it pulsed with a heart .	form		Giant|air|eagle|edge|explanations|form|lady|nothingness|side|something

12 You have heard of whirlpools in water ; well , this was just like a whirlpool of air .
13 Even the Giant himself could hardly keep his legs against it ; then he tossed Jaqueline up , and the airy whirlpool seized her and carried her , as if on a tide of water , always round and round in narrowing circles , till she was sucked down into the hollow hill .
14 Even as she went , she seemed to remember the hill , as if she had dreamed about it , and the shape and colour of the country .

9 `` There is no way , or we should have found it , '' said one of the maidens ; `` and , if you are the wrong girl , by the day after to-morrow they must send the right one , otherwise the Earthquaker will waken , and shake the world , and destroy Manoa , the City of the Sun . ''
10 Then they all wept softly in the stillness .
11 `` Can we get anything to eat here ? ''
12 asked poor Jaqueline , at last .
13 She was beginning to be very hungry , and however alarmed she might be , she felt that dinner would not be unwelcome .
14 The tallest of the maidens clapped her hands , and immediately a long table was spread by unseen sprites with meringues and cold chicken , and several sorts of delicious ices .
15 We shall desert Jaqueline , who was rather less alarmed when she found that she was not to be starved , at all events , and return to Prince Ricardo , whom we left fluttering about as a little golden-crested wren .
16 He followed the Giant and Jaqueline into the whirlpool of air as far as he dared , and when he saw her vanish down the cone of the hill , he flew straight back to Pantouflia .

10 And then the king told them about Jaqueline and the Earthquaker , and how he needed a great weight of Stupidity to flatten him out with .

12 `` Here I may go no further , '' said the bright lady ; `` and beyond , as you see , all is darkness and heavy sleep . ''
13 Then she touched Prigio with her golden wand with twisted serpents , and he became luminous , light raying out from him ; and the dark lady , too , shone like silver in the night : and on they flew , over black rocks and black rivers , till they reached a huge mountain , like a mountain of coal , many thousand feet high , for its head was lost in the blackness of darkness .

13 The End .
14 -LCB- Man with rock : p186.jpg -RCB- It was on a strange sight that the king and Ricardo looked down from the Flying Horse .
15 Beneath them lay the City of Manoa , filling with its golden battlements and temples a hollow of the mountains .
16 Here were palaces all carved over with faces of men and beasts , and with twisted patterns of serpents .
17 The city walls were built of huge square stones , and among the groves towered pyramids , on which the people did service to their gods .
18 From every temple top came the roar of beaten drums , great drums of serpentskin .
19 But , in the centre of the chief square of the town , was gathered a wild crowd of men in shining copper armour and helmets of gold and glittering dresses of feathers .
20 Among them ran about priests with hideous masks , crying them on to besiege and break down the royal palace .

16 A moment more , and he would waken in his strength ; and once awake , he would shatter the city walls and ruin Manoa .

5 The sun was approaching mid-day , and Prigio put spurs to the Flying Horse .
6 Ten minutes more , and the sun would look straight down the crater of the hollow hill , and the Earthquaker would arouse himself when the light and the heat fell on his body .
7 Already the light of the sun shone slanting half-way down the hollow cone as the whirlpool of air caught the Flying Horse , and drew him swiftly down and down to the shadowy halls .
8 There knelt and wept the nurses of the Earthquaker on the marble floor ; but Jaqueline stood a little apart , very pale , but not weeping .
9 Ricardo had leaped off before the horse touched the ground , and rushed to Jaqueline , and embraced her in his arms ; and , oh !
