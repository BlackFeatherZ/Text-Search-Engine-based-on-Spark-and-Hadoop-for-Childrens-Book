15 However , in consideration of what the youth had done the day before , he hoped his majesty 's heart might be softened , especially as he had sent a message that they might expect him at once .
16 With this the bridal pair had to be content , and be as patient as they could till the king 's arrival .
17 He did not keep them long , but they saw by his face that nothing good awaited them .
18 ` The marriage can not take place , ' he said shortly , 'till the youth has joined to their roots all the trees he cut down yesterday . '

18 In an hour or two , so many were gathered round the cradle , that the child seemed in danger of being smothered ; but the king , who was watching the fairies eagerly , was disturbed to see them looking grave .

6 This he sucked , as he had been told to do by the old woman , and immediately the princess came to herself , and flung her arms round his neck .
7 Then she told him all her story , and what had happened since the ship had sailed away without him .
8 ` But the worst misfortune of all , ' she added , ` was a battle which my father lost because you had vanished with his magic sword ; and out of his whole army hardly one man was left . '
9 ` Show me the battle-field , ' said he .
10 And she took him to a wild heath , where the dead were lying as they fell , waiting for burial .

1 The hearts of the other young men were touched as soon as they heard this story , and they did everything they could think of to make him forget his past sorrows .
2 ` What are you doing here ? '
3 said the youth , one day .
4 ` We spend our whole time climbing up the walls of the palace , trying to reach the windows of the princess , ' answered the young men ; ` but , as yet , no one has reached within ten feet of them . '
5 ` Oh , let me try too , ' cried the prince ; ` but to-morrow I will wait and see what you do before I begin .
6 So the next day he stood where he could watch the young men go up , and he noted the places on the wall that seemed most difficult , and made up his mind that when his turn came he would go up some other way .
7 Day after day he was to be seen watching the wooers , till , one morning , he felt that he knew the plan of the walls by heart , and took his place by the side of the others .
8 Thanks to what he had learned from the failure of the rest , he managed to grasp one little rough projection after another , till at last , to the envy of his friends , he stood on the sill of the princess 's window .
9 Looking up from below , they saw a white hand stretched forth to draw him in .
10 Then one of the young men ran straight to the king 's palace , and said : ` The wall has been climbed , and the prize is won ! '
11 ` By whom ? '
12 cried the king , starting up from his throne ; ` which of the princes may I claim as my son-in-law ? '
13 ` The youth who succeeded in climbing to the princess 's window is not a prince at all , ' answered the young man .
14 ` He is the son of the master of the horse to the great king who dwells across the river , and he fled from his own country to escape from the hatred of his stepmother . '
15 At this news the king was very angry , for it had never entered his head that anyone BUT a prince would seek to woo his daughter .
16 ` Let him go back to the land whence he came , ' he shouted in wrath ; ` does he expect me to give my daughter to an exile ? '

5 However , the king had taken such a fancy to the youth that he said no more , and the marriage took place the following day , and great herds of cattle and a large estate were given to the young couple .
6 After a little while the prince said to his wife : ` My life is in the hands of three creatures -- a crocodile , a serpent , and a dog . '
7 ` Ah , how rash you are ! '

16 When the prince and princess had been married a few months , the prince heard that his stepmother was dead , and his father was old and ill , and longing to have his eldest son by his side again .
17 The young man could not remain deaf to such a message , and he took a tender farewell of his wife , and set out on his journey home .
18 It was a long way , and he was forced to rest often on the road , and so it happened that , one night , when he was sleeping in a city on the banks of the great river , a huge crocodile came silently up and made its way along a passage to the prince 's room .
19 Fortunately one of his guards woke up as it was trying to steal past them , and shut the crocodile up in a large hall , where a giant watched over it , never leaving the spot except during the night , when the crocodile slept .
20 And this went on for more than a month .
21 Now , when the XXXXX found that he was not likely to leave his father 's kingdom again , he sent for his wife , and bade the messenger tell her that he would await her coming in the town on the banks of the great river .	prince		blood|city|crocodile|father|king|man|palace|prince|princess|reasons

7 It was a long way , and he was forced to rest often on the road , and so it happened that , one night , when he was sleeping in a city on the banks of the great river , a huge crocodile came silently up and made its way along a passage to the prince 's room .
8 Fortunately one of his guards woke up as it was trying to steal past them , and shut the crocodile up in a large hall , where a giant watched over it , never leaving the spot except during the night , when the crocodile slept .
9 And this went on for more than a month .
10 Now , when the prince found that he was not likely to leave his father 's kingdom again , he sent for his wife , and bade the messenger tell her that he would await her coming in the town on the banks of the great river .
11 This was the reason why he delayed his journey so long , and narrowly escaped being eaten by the crocodile .
12 During the weeks that followed the prince amused himself as best he could , though he counted the minutes to the arrival of the princess , and when she did come , he at once prepared to start for the court .
13 That very night , however , while he was asleep , the princess noticed something strange in one of the corners of the room .
14 It was a dark patch , and seemed , as she looked , to grow longer and longer , and to be moving slowly towards the cushions on which the prince was lying .
15 She shrank in terror , but , slight as was the noise , the thing heard it , and raised its head to listen .
16 Then she saw it was the long flat head of a serpent , and the recollection of the prophecy rushed into her mind .
17 Without waking her husband , she glided out of bed , and taking up a heavy bowl of milk which stood on a table , laid it on the floor in the path of the serpent -- for she knew that no serpent in the world can resist milk .
18 She held her breath as the snake drew near , and watched it throw up its head again as if it was smelling something nice , while its forky tongue darted out greedily .
19 At length its eyes fell upon the milk , and in an instant it was lapping it so fast that it was a wonder the creature did not choke , for it never took its head from the bowl as long as a drop was left in it .
20 After that it dropped on the ground and slept heavily .
