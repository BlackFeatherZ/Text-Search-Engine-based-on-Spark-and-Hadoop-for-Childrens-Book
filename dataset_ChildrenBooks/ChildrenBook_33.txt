2 Upon this the prince sent for four swift and strong horses , and had the negro bound to each one of them ; then each was driven to one of the four quarters , and he tore in pieces like muslin .

15 Ball-carrier and the Bad One Far , far in the forest there were two little huts , and in each of them lived a man who was a famous hunter , his wife , and three or four children .
16 Now the children were forbidden to play more than a short distance from the door , as it was known that , away on the other side of the wood near the great river , there dwelt a witch who had a magic ball that she used as a means of stealing children .
17 Her plan was a very simple one , and had never yet failed .
18 When she wanted a child she just flung her ball in the direction of the child 's home , and however far off it might be , the ball was sure to reach it .
19 Then , as soon as the child saw it , the ball would begin rolling slowly back to the witch , just keeping a little ahead of the child , so that he always thought that he could catch it the next minute .
20 But he never did , and , what was more , his parents never saw him again .
21 Of course you must not suppose that all the fathers and mothers who had lost children made no attempts to find them , but the XXXXX was so large , and the witch was so cunning in knowing exactly where they were going to search , that it was very easy for her to keep out of the way .	forest		Footnotes|distance|door|forest|man|omen|possession|reservations|side|witch

18 At last , after many days , he came to the river , and beyond it he noticed a small hut standing on a hill which he guessed to be the home of the Bad One .

2 In a minute or two he plucked up courage to go a little further into the river , but again its width frightened him , and a second time he turned back .
3 However , he felt rather ashamed of his cowardice , as it was quite clear that his ball could support him , and on his third trial he got safely to the other side .

11 She cried to her master that someone had stolen both the bag and the bridge , and the Bad One rushed in , mad with anger , and bade her go and seek for footsteps outside , that they might find out where the thief had gone .
12 In a few minutes she returned , saying that he must be in the house , as she could not see any footsteps leading to the river , and began to move all the furniture in the room , without discovering Ball Carrier .

18 Lung-Woman lost no time in obeying her orders .
19 She built up the fire , which had got very low , filled the kettle with water , and passing a rope which hung from the ceiling through the handle , swung it over the flames .
20 Then she brought in Ball-Carrier , who , seeing all these preparations , wished that as long as he was in the kettle the water might not really boil , though it would hiss and bubble , and also , that the spirits would turn the water into fat .
21 The kettle soon began to sing and XXXXX , and Ball Carrier was lifted in .	bubble		broth|bubble|cooking|dinner|friends|laugh|servant|sign|spirits|woman

1 The Bad One made a sign to the woman , who inquired where he had hidden them .
2 He lifted his left arm where the gold was , and she picked up a knife and scraped his skin so that no gold should be left sticking to it .
3 ` What have you done with the bridge ? '
4 said she .
5 And he lifted his right arm , from which she took the bridge , while the Bad One looked on , well pleased .
6 ` Be sure that he does not run away , ' chuckled he .
7 ` Boil some water , and get him ready for cooking , while I go and invite my friends the water-demons to the feast . '
8 The woman seized Ball-Carrier between her finger and thumb , and was going to carry him to the kitchen , when the boy spoke : ' I am very lean and small now , ' he said , ` hardly worth the trouble of cooking ; but if you were to keep me two days , and gave me plenty of food , I should get big and fat .
9 As it is , your friends the water-demons would think you meant to laugh at them , when they found that I was the feast . '
10 ` Well , perhaps you are right , ' answered the Bad One ; ' I will keep you for two days . '
11 And he went out to visit the water-demons .
12 Meanwhile the servant , whose name was Lung Woman , led him into a little shed , and chained him up to a ring in the wall .
13 But food was given him every hour , and at the end of two days he was as fat and big as a Christmas turkey , and could hardly move his head from one side to the other .
14 ` He will do now , ' said the Bad One , who came constantly to see how he was getting on . '
15 I shall go and tell the water-demons that we expect them to dinner to-night .
16 Put the kettle on the fire , but be sure on no account to taste the broth . '
17 Lung-Woman lost no time in obeying her orders .
18 She built up the fire , which had got very low , filled the kettle with water , and passing a rope which hung from the ceiling through the handle , swung it over the flames .
19 Then she brought in Ball-Carrier , who , seeing all these preparations , wished that as long as he was in the kettle the water might not really boil , though it would hiss and bubble , and also , that the spirits would turn the water into fat .
20 The kettle soon began to sing and bubble , and Ball Carrier was lifted in .
21 Very soon the fat which was to make the sauce rose to the surface , and Ball-Carrier , who was bobbing about from one side to the other , called out that Lung-Woman had better taste the XXXXX , as he though that some salt should be added to it .	broth		account|broth|finger|food|friends|kitchen|name|preparations|skin|spirits
