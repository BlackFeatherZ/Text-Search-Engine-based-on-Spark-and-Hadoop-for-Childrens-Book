1 ` My father has more money than he knows what to do with , and he will give me as much as I want for both of us ; only , there is one thing you must promise me , Rosald , that , supposing we have any adventures , you will let the honour and glory of them fall to me . '
2 ` Yes , of course , that is only fair , ' answered Rosald , who never cared about putting himself forward .
3 ` But I can not go without telling my parents .

5 As soon as the business was finished , Rosald hastened home .

10 They had not gone very far , when , riding across a mountain , they caught a glimpse of several armed men hiding amongst some trees in their path , and remembered suddenly some talk they had heard of a band of twelve robbers who lay in wait for rich travellers .

12 They were all called ` Hankur , ' and were distinguished one from another by the name of a colour -- blue , grey , red , and so on , except their chief , who was known as Hankur the Tall .
13 All this and more rushed into the minds of the two young men as they saw the flash of their swords in the moonlight .
14 ` It is impossible to fight them -- they are twelve to two , ' whispered Geirald , stopping his horse in the path .
15 ` We had much better ride back and take the lower road .

9 Let us tie up our horses here , and climb up the rocks so that we can roll stones down on them . '
10 ` Well , we might try that , and then we shall always have our horses , ' said Geirald .
11 So they went up the rocks silently and carefully .
12 The robbers were lying all ready , expecting every moment to see their victims coming round the corner a few yards away , when a shower of huge stones fell on their heads , killing half the band .
13 The others sprang up the rock , but as they reached the top the sword of Rosald swung round , and one man after another rolled down into the valley .
14 At last the chief managed to spring up , and , grasping Rosald by the waist , flung away his sword , and the two fought desperately , their bodies swaying always nearer the edge .
15 It seemed as if Rosald , being the smaller of the two , MUST fall over , when , with his left hand , he drew the robber 's sword out of its sheath and plunged it into his heart .
16 Then he took from the dead man a beautiful ring set with a large stone , and put it on his own finger .
17 The fame of this wonderful deed soon spread through the country , and people would often stop Geirald 's horse , and ask leave to see the robber 's ring , which was said to have been stolen from the father of the reigning king .
18 And Geirald showed them the ring with pride , and listened to their words of praise , and no one would ever have guessed anyone else had destroyed the robbers .
19 In a few days they left the kingdom and rode on to another , where they thought they would stop through the remainder of the winter , for Geirald liked to be comfortable , and did not care about travelling through ice and snow .
20 But the king would only grant them leave to stop on condition that , before the winter was ended , they should give him some fresh proof of the courage of which he had heard so much .

1 And Geirald showed them the ring with pride , and listened to their words of praise , and no one would ever have guessed anyone else had destroyed the robbers .
2 In a few days they left the kingdom and rode on to another , where they thought they would stop through the remainder of the winter , for Geirald liked to be comfortable , and did not care about travelling through ice and snow .
3 But the king would only grant them leave to stop on condition that , before the winter was ended , they should give him some fresh proof of the courage of which he had heard so much .
4 Rosald 's heart was glad at the king 's message , and as for Geirald , he felt that as long as Rosald was there all would go well .
5 So they both bowed low and replied that it was the king 's place to command and theirs to obey .
6 ` Well , then , ' said his Majesty , ` this is what I want you to do : In the north-east part of my kingdom there dwells a giant , who has an iron staff twenty yards long , and he is so quick in using it , that even fifty knights have no chance against him .
7 The bravest and strongest young men of my court have fallen under the blows of that staff ; but , as you overcame the twelve robbers so easily , I feel that I have reason to hope that you may be able to conquer the giant .
8 In three days from this you will set out . '
9 ` We will be ready , your Majesty , ' answered Rosald ; but Geirald remained silent .
10 ` How can we possibly fight against a giant that has killed fifty knights ? '
11 cried Geirald , when they were outside the castle .
12 ` The king only wants to get rid of us !
13 He wo n't think about us for the next three days -- that is one comfort -- so we shall have plenty of time to cross the borders of the kingdom and be out of reach . '
14 ` We may n't be able to kill the giant , but we certainly ca n't run away till we have tried , ' answered Rosald .
15 ` Besides , think how glorious it will be if we DO manage to kill him !
16 I know what sort of weapon I shall use .
17 Come with me now , and I will see about it . '
18 And , taking his friend by the arm , he led him into a shop where he bought a huge lump of solid iron , so big that they could hardly lift it between them .

4 However , they just managed to carry it to a blacksmith 's where Rosald directed that it should be beaten into a thick club , with a sharp spike at one end .
5 When this was done to his liking he took it home under his arm .
6 Very early on the third morning the two young men started on their journey , and on the fourth day they reached the giant 's cave before he was out of bed .
7 Hearing the sound of footsteps , the giant got up and went to the entrance to see who was coming , and Rosald , expecting something of the sort , struck him such a blow on the forehead that he fell to the ground .
8 Then , before he could rise to his feet again , Rosald drew out his sword and cut off his head .
9 ` It was not so difficult after all , you see , ' he said , turning to Geirald .
10 And placing the giant 's head in a leathern wallet which was slung over his back , they began their journey to the castle .
11 As they drew near the gates , Rosald took the head from the wallet and handed it to Geirald , whom he followed into the king 's presence .
12 ` The giant will trouble you no more , ' said Geirald , holding out the head .
13 And the king fell on his neck and kissed him , and cried joyfully that he was the ` bravest knight in all the world , and that a feast should be made for him and Rosald , and that the great deed should be proclaimed throughout the kingdom . '
14 And Geirald 's heart swelled with pride , and he almost forgot that it was Rosald and not he , who had slain the giant .
15 By-and-by a whisper went round that a beautiful lady who lived in the castle would be present at the feast , with twenty-four lovely maidens , her attendants .
16 The lady was the queen of her own country , but as her father and mother had died when she was a little girl , she had been left in the care of this king who was her uncle .
17 She was now old enough to govern her own kingdom , but her subjects did not like being ruled by a woman , and said that she must find a husband to help her in managing her affairs .
18 Prince after prince had offered himself , but the young queen would have nothing to say to any of them , and at last told her ministers that if she was to have a husband at all she must choose him for herself , as she would certainly not marry any of those whom they had selected for her .
19 The ministers replied that in that case she had better manage her kingdom alone , and the queen , who knew nothing about business , got things into such a confusion that at last she threw them up altogether , and went off to her uncle .
20 Now when she heard how the two young men had slain the giant , her heart was filled with admiration of their courage , and she declared that if a feast was held she would certainly be present at it .
21 And so she was ; and when the feast was over she asked the XXXXX , her guardian , if he would allow the two heroes who had killed the robbers and slain the giant to fight a tourney the next day with one of her pages .	king		arm|country|courage|husband|king|lady|neck|presence|shop|subjects

7 She was now old enough to govern her own kingdom , but her subjects did not like being ruled by a woman , and said that she must find a husband to help her in managing her affairs .
8 Prince after prince had offered himself , but the young queen would have nothing to say to any of them , and at last told her ministers that if she was to have a husband at all she must choose him for herself , as she would certainly not marry any of those whom they had selected for her .
9 The ministers replied that in that case she had better manage her kingdom alone , and the queen , who knew nothing about business , got things into such a confusion that at last she threw them up altogether , and went off to her uncle .
10 Now when she heard how the two young men had slain the giant , her heart was filled with admiration of their courage , and she declared that if a feast was held she would certainly be present at it .
11 And so she was ; and when the feast was over she asked the king , her guardian , if he would allow the two heroes who had killed the robbers and slain the giant to fight a tourney the next day with one of her pages .
12 The king gladly gave his consent , and ordered the lists to be made ready , never doubting that two great champions would be eager for such a chance of adding to their fame .
13 Little did he guess that Geirald had done all he could to persuade Rosald to steal secretly out of the castle during the night , ` for , ' said he , ' I do n't believe they are pages at all , but well-proved knights , and how can we , so young and untried , stand up against them ? '
14 ` The honour will be all the higher if we gain the day , ' answered Rosald ; but Geirald would listen to nothing , and only declared that he did not care about honour , and would rather be alive than have every honour in the world heaped upon him .
15 Go he would , and as Rosald had sworn to give him his company , he must come with him .
16 Rosald was much grieved when he heard these words , but he knew that it was useless attempting to persuade Geirald , and turned his thoughts to forming some plan to prevent this disgraceful flight .
17 Suddenly his face brightened .
18 ` Let us change clothes , ' he said , ` and I will do the fighting , while you shall get the glory .
19 Nobody will ever know . '
20 And to this Geirald readily consented .

3 ` You have done what I expected you to do , ' said he , ` and now , choose your reward . '
4 ` Grant me , sire , the hand of the queen , your niece , ' replied the young man , bowing low , ` and I will defend her kingdom against all her enemies . '
5 ` She could choose no better husband , ' said the king , ` and if she consents I do . '
6 And he turned towards the queen , who had not been present during the fight , but had just slipped into a seat by his right hand .
7 Now the queen 's eyes were very sharp , and it seemed to her that the man who stood before her , tall and handsome though he might be , was different in many slight ways , and in one in particular , from the man who had fought the tourney .
8 How there could be any trickery she could not understand , and why the real victor should be willing to give up his prize to another was still stranger ; but something in her heart warned her to be careful .
9 She answered : ` You may be satisfied , uncle , but I am not .
10 One more proof I must have ; let the two young men now fight against each other .
11 The man I marry must be the man who killed the robbers and the giant , and overcame my page . '
12 Geirald 's face grew pale as he heard these words .
13 He knew there was no escape from him now , though he did not doubt for one moment that Rosald would keep his compact loyally to the last .
14 But how would it be possible that even Rosald should deceive the watchful eyes of the king and his court , and still more those of the young queen whom he felt uneasily had suspected him from the first ?
15 The tourney was fought , and in spite of Geirald 's fears Rosald managed to hang back to make attacks which were never meant to succeed , and to allow strokes which he could easily have parried to attain their end .
16 At length , after a great show of resistance , he fell heavily to the ground .
17 And as he fell he knew that it was not alone the glory that was his rightfully which he gave up , but the hand of the queen that was more precious still .
18 But Geirald did not even wait to see if he was wounded ; he went straight to the wall where the royal banner waved and claimed the reward which was now his .
19 The crowd of watchers turned towards the queen , expecting to see her stoop and give some token to the victor .
20 Instead , to the surprise of everyone , she merely smiled gracefully , and said that before she bestowed her hand one more test must be imposed , but this should be the last .
21 The final tourney should be fought ; Geirald and Rosald should meet singly two knights of the king 's court , and he who could unhorse his foe should be master of herself and of her XXXXX .	kingdom		Grant|end|giant|husband|kingdom|prize|strokes|victor|wall|ways

2 Habogi Once upon a time there lived two peasants who had three daughters , and , as generally happens , the youngest was the most beautiful and the best tempered , and when her sisters wanted to go out she was always ready to stay at home and do their work .
3 Years passed quickly with the whole family , and one day the parents suddenly perceived that all three girls were grown up , and that very soon they would be thinking of marriage .
4 ` Have you decided what your husband 's name is to be ? '
5 said the father , laughingly , to his eldest daughter , one evening when they were all sitting at the door of their cottage .
6 ` You know that is a very important point ! '
7 ` Yes ; I will never wed any man who is not called Sigmund , ' answered she .
8 ` Well , it is lucky for you that there are a great many Sigmunds in this part of the world , ' replied her father , ` so that you can take your choice !
9 And what do YOU say ? '
10 he added , turning to the second .
11 ` Oh , I think that there is no name so beautiful as Sigurd , ' cried she .
12 ` Then you wo n't be an old maid either , ' answered he .
13 ` There are seven Sigurds in the next village alone !
14 And you , Helga ? '
15 Helga , who was still the prettiest of the three , looked up .
16 She also had her favourite name , but , just as she was going to say it , she seemed to hear a voice whisper : ` Marry no one who is not called Habogi . '
17 The girl had never heard of such a name , and did not like it , so she determined to pay no attention ; but as she opened her mouth to tell her father that her husband must be called Njal , she found herself answering instead : ` If I do marry it will be to no one except Habogi . '
18 ` Who IS Habogi ? '
19 asked her father and sisters ; ` We never heard of such a person . '
20 ` All I can tell you is that he will be my husband , if ever I have one , ' returned Helga ; and that was all she would say .

2 Before very long the young men who lived in the neighbouring villages or on the sides of the mountains , had heard of this talk of the three girls , and Sigmunds and Sigurds in scores came to visit the little cottage .
3 There were other young men too , who bore different names , though not one of them was called ` Habogi , ' and these thought that they might perhaps gain the heart of the youngest .
4 But though there was more than one ` Njal ' amongst them , Helga 's eyes seemed always turned another way .
5 At length the two elder sisters made their choice from out of the Sigurds and the Sigmunds , and it was decided that both weddings should take place at the same time .
6 Invitations were sent out to the friends and relations , and when , on the morning of the great day , they were all assembled , a rough , coarse old peasant left the crowd and came up to the brides ' father .
7 ` My name is Habogi , and Helga must be my wife , ' was all he said .
8 And though Helga stood pale and trembling with surprise , she did not try to run away . '
9 I can not talk of such things just now , ' answered the father , who could not bear the thought of giving his favourite daughter to this horrible old man , and hoped , by putting it off , that something might happen .
10 But the sisters , who had always been rather jealous of Helga , were secretly pleased that their bridegrooms should outshine hers .
11 When the feast was over , Habogi led up a beautiful horse from a field where he had left it to graze , and bade Helga jump up on its splendid saddle , all embroidered in scarlet and gold .
12 ` You shall come back again , ' said he ; ` but now you must see the house that you are to live in . '
13 And though Helga was very unwilling to go , something inside her forced her to obey .
14 The old man settled her comfortably , then sprang up in front of her as easily as if he had been a boy , and , shaking the reins , they were soon out of sight .
15 After some miles they rode through a meadow with grass so green that Helga 's eyes felt quite dazzled ; and feeding on the grass were a quantity of large fat sheep , with the curliest and whitest wool in the world .
16 ` What lovely sheep !
17 whose are they ? '
18 cried Helga .
19 ` Your Habogi 's , ' answered he , ` all that you see belongs to him ; but the finest sheep in the whole herd , which has little golden bells hanging between its horns , you shall have for yourself . '
20 This pleased Helga very much , for she had never had anything of her own ; and she smiled quite happily as she thanked Habogi for his present .

1 Helga had so much to think about , that the ride home appeared very short .
2 Her father and mother were delighted to see her , as they did not feel sure that so ugly and cross-looking a man as Habogi might not have played her some cruel trick .
3 And after they had given her some supper they begged her to tell them all she had done .
4 But Helga only told them that they should see for themselves on the third day , when they would come to her wedding .
5 It was very early in the morning when the party set out , and Helga 's two sisters grew green with envy as they passed the flocks of sheep , and cows , and horses , and heard that the best of each was given to Helga herself ; but when they caught sight of the poor little house which was to be her home their hearts grew light again . '
6 I should be ashamed of living in such a place , ' whispered each to the other ; and the eldest sister spoke of the carved stone over HER doorway , and the second boasted of the number of rooms SHE had .
7 But the moment they went inside they were struck dumb with rage at the splendour of everything , and their faces grew white and cold with fury when they saw the dress which Habogi had prepared for his bride -- a dress that glittered like sunbeams dancing upon ice .
8 ` She SHALL not look so much finer than us , ' they cried passionately to each other as soon as they were alone ; and when night came they stole out of their rooms , and taking out the wedding-dress , they laid it in the ash-pit , and heaped ashes upon it .
9 But Habogi , who knew a little magic , and had guessed what they would do , changed the ashes into roses , and cast a spell over the sisters , so that they could not leave the spot for a whole day , and every one who passed by mocked at them .
10 The next morning when they all awoke the ugly tumble-down house had disappeared , and in its place stood a splendid palace .
11 The guests ' eyes sought in vain for the bridegroom , but could only see a handsome young man , with a coat of blue velvet and silver and a gold crown upon his head .
12 ` Who is that ? '
13 they asked Helga .
14 ` That is my Habogi , ' said she .

16 How the Little Brother Set Free His Big Brothers In a small hut , right in the middle of the forest , lived a man , his wife , three sons and a daughter .
17 For some reason , all the animals seemed to have left that part of the country , and food grew very scarce ; so , one morning , after a night of snow , when the tracks of beasts might be easily seen , the three boys started off to hunt .
18 They kept together for some time , till they reached a place where the path they had been following split into two , and one of the brothers called his dog and went to the left , while the others took the trail to the right .
19 These had not gone far when their dogs scented a bear , and drove him out from the thicket .
20 The bear ran across a clearing , and the elder brother managed to place an arrow right in his head .

1 But the moment they went inside they were struck dumb with rage at the splendour of everything , and their faces grew white and cold with fury when they saw the dress which Habogi had prepared for his bride -- a dress that glittered like sunbeams dancing upon ice .
2 ` She SHALL not look so much finer than us , ' they cried passionately to each other as soon as they were alone ; and when night came they stole out of their rooms , and taking out the wedding-dress , they laid it in the ash-pit , and heaped ashes upon it .
3 But Habogi , who knew a little magic , and had guessed what they would do , changed the ashes into roses , and cast a spell over the sisters , so that they could not leave the spot for a whole day , and every one who passed by mocked at them .
4 The next morning when they all awoke the ugly tumble-down house had disappeared , and in its place stood a splendid palace .
5 The guests ' eyes sought in vain for the bridegroom , but could only see a handsome young man , with a coat of blue velvet and silver and a gold crown upon his head .

10 How the Little Brother Set Free His Big Brothers In a small hut , right in the middle of the forest , lived a man , his wife , three sons and a daughter .
11 For some reason , all the animals seemed to have left that part of the country , and food grew very scarce ; so , one morning , after a night of snow , when the tracks of beasts might be easily seen , the three boys started off to hunt .
12 They kept together for some time , till they reached a place where the path they had been following split into two , and one of the brothers called his dog and went to the left , while the others took the trail to the right .
13 These had not gone far when their dogs scented a bear , and drove him out from the thicket .
14 The bear ran across a clearing , and the elder brother managed to place an arrow right in his head .
15 They both took up the bear , and carried it towards home , meeting the third at the spot where they had parted from him .
16 When they reached home they threw the bear down on the floor of the hut saying , ` Father , here is a bear which we killed ; now we can have some dinner . '
17 But the father , who was in a bad temper , only said : ` When I was a young man we used to get two bears in one day . '
18 The sons were rather disappointed at hearing this , and though there was plenty of meat to last for two or three days , they started off early in the morning down the same trail that they had followed before .
19 As they drew near the fork a bear suddenly ran out from behind a tree , and took the path on the right .

1 But the father , who was in a bad temper , only said : ` When I was a young man we used to get two bears in one day . '
2 The sons were rather disappointed at hearing this , and though there was plenty of meat to last for two or three days , they started off early in the morning down the same trail that they had followed before .
3 As they drew near the fork a bear suddenly ran out from behind a tree , and took the path on the right .
4 The two elder boys and their dogs pursued him , and soon the second son , who was also a good shot , killed him instantly with an arrow .

7 The next day they were luckier than before , and brought back three bears , on which their father told them that HE had always killed four .
8 However , that did not prevent him from skinning the bears and cooking them in a way of his own , which he thought very good , and they all ate an excellent supper .
9 Now these bears were the servants of the great bear chief who lived in a high mountain a long way off .
10 And every time a bear was killed his shadow returned to the house of the bear chief , with the marks of his wounds plainly to bee seen by the rest .
11 The chief was furious at the number of bears the hunters had killed , and determined that he would find some way of destroying them .
12 So he called another of his servants , and said to him : ` Go to the thicket near the fork , where the boys killed your brothers , and directly they or the dogs see you return here as fast as ever you can .
13 The mountain will open to let you in , and the hunters will follow you .
