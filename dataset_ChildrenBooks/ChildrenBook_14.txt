4 Or , when they sat of an evening around the fire telling stories which made one 's flesh creep , the listeners sometimes said : `` Oh !

6 `` They are always saying it makes one shudder !

8 Nothing makes me shudder .

10 Now it happened that his father said to him one day : `` Hearken , you there in the corner ; you are growing big and strong , and you must learn to earn your own bread .
11 Look at your brother , what pains he takes ; but all the money I 've spent on your education is thrown away . ''

18 There was also much treasure hid in the castle , guarded by evil spirits , which would then be free , and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich .
19 Many had already gone in , but so far none had ever come out again .

10 But when he had thus sent the two of them to their final rest , and was again about to sit down at the fire , out of every nook and corner came forth black cats and black dogs with fiery chains in such swarms that he could n't possibly get away from them .
11 They yelled in the most ghastly manner , jumped upon his fire , scattered it all , and tried to put it out .
12 He looked on quietly for a time , but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife and called out : `` Be off , you rabble rout ! ''
13 and let fly at them .
14 Some of them fled away , and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the pond below .
15 When he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once more , and warmed himself .
16 And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer , and a desire to sleep stole over him .
17 Then he looked around him and beheld in the corner a large bed .
18 `` The very thing , '' he said , and laid himself down in it .
19 But when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by itself , and ran all round the castle .
20 `` Capital , '' he said , `` only a little quicker . ''
21 Then the XXXXX sped on as if drawn by six horses , over thresholds and stairs , up this way and down that .	bed		Friend|bed|beheld|bench|castle|claws|dogs|pond|thing|time

12 All of a sudden -- crash , crash !
13 with a bound it turned over , upside down , and lay like a mountain on the top of him .
14 But he tossed the blankets and pillows in the air , emerged from underneath , and said : `` Now anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive , '' lay down at his fire , and slept till daylight .
15 In the morning the King came , and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much for him , and that he was dead .

12 `` Come , '' said the youth , `` I did n't bargain for that , the seat is mine . ''
13 The man tried to shove him away , but the youth would n't allow it for a moment , and , pushing him off by force , sat down in his place again .
14 Then more men dropped down , one after the other , who fetching nine skeleton legs and two skulls , put them up and played ninepins with them .
15 The youth thought he would like to play too , and said : `` Look here ; do you mind my joining the game ? ''
16 `` No , not if you have money . ''
17 `` I 've money enough , '' he replied , `` but your balls are n't round enough . ''

1 Then the King was astonished , but very glad , and asked how it had fared with him .
2 `` First-rate , '' he answered ; `` and now I 've survived the one night , I shall get through the other two also . ''
3 The landlord , when he went to him , opened his eyes wide , and said : `` Well , I never thought to see you alive again .
4 Have you learned now what shuddering is ? ''
5 `` No , '' he replied , `` it 's quite hopeless ; if someone could only tell me how to ! ''
6 The second night he went up again to the old castle , sat down at the fire , and began his old refrain : `` If I could only shudder ! ''
7 As midnight approached , a noise and din broke out , at first gentle , but gradually increasing ; then all was quiet for a minute , and at length , with a loud scream , half of a man dropped down the chimney and fell before him .
8 `` Hi , up there ! ''
9 shouted he ; `` there 's another half wanted down here , that 's not enough '' ; then the din commenced once more , there was a shrieking and a yelling , and then the other half fell down .
10 `` Wait a bit , '' he said ; `` I 'll stir up the fire for you . ''
11 When he had done this and again looked around , the two pieces had united , and a horrible-looking man sat on his seat .

8 When the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full of straw , gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle , and said : `` Now set to work and spin all night till early dawn , and if by that time you have n't spun the straw into gold you shall die . ''

10 So the poor miller 's daughter sat down , and did n't know what in the world she was to do .
11 She had n't the least idea of how to spin straw into gold , and became at last so miserable that she began to cry .
12 Suddenly the door opened , and in stepped a tiny little man and said : `` Good-evening , Miss Miller-maid ; why are you crying so bitterly ? ''

15 `` What will you give me if I spin it for you ? ''
16 asked the manikin .

18 The little man took the necklace , sat himself down at the wheel , and whir , whir , whir , the wheel went round three times , and the bobbin was full .
19 Then he put on another , and whir , whir , whir , the wheel went round three times , and the second too was full ; and so it went on till the morning , when all the straw was spun away , and all the bobbins were full of gold .
20 As soon as the sun rose the King came , and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and delighted , but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious metal .
21 He had the miller 's XXXXX put into another room full of straw , much bigger than the first , and bade her , if she valued her life , spin it all into gold before the following morning .	daughter		audience|bobbins|daughter|heart|manikin|metal|necklace|shuddering|time|wife

9 After two years , when they were all beginning to get used to their new life , something happened to disturb their tranquillity .
10 Their father received the news that one of his ships , which he had believed to be lost , had come safely into port with a rich cargo .
11 All the sons and daughters at once thought that their poverty was at an end , and wanted to set out directly for the town ; but their father , who was more prudent , begged them to wait a little , and , though it was harvest time , and he could ill be spared , determined to go himself first , to make inquiries .
12 Only the youngest daughter had any doubt but that they would soon again be as rich as they were before , or at least rich enough to live comfortably in some town where they would find amusement and gay companions once more .
13 So they all loaded their father with commissions for jewels and dresses which it would have taken a fortune to buy ; only Beauty , feeling sure that it was of no use , did not ask for anything .
14 Her father , noticing her silence , said : `` And what shall I bring for you , Beauty ? ''
15 `` The only thing I wish for is to see you come home safely , '' she answered .
16 But this only vexed her sisters , who fancied she was blaming them for having asked for such costly things .
17 Her father , however , was pleased , but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like pretty presents , he told her to choose something .
18 `` Well , dear father , '' she said , `` as you insist upon it , I beg that you will bring me a rose .
19 I have not seen one since we came here , and I love them so much . ''
20 So the merchant set out and reached the town as quickly as possible , but only to find that his former companions , believing him to be dead , had divided between them the goods which the ship had brought ; and after six months of trouble and expense he found himself as poor as when he started , having been able to recover only just enough to pay the cost of his journey .
21 To make matters worse , he was obliged to leave the XXXXX in the most terrible weather , so that by the time he was within a few leagues of his home he was almost exhausted with cold and fatigue .	town		companions|daughter|fields|help|luxuries|ships|sisters|thing|town|tranquillity

1 Indeed , the daughters at first hoped that their friends , who had been so numerous while they were rich , would insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed one .
2 But they soon found that they were left alone , and that their former friends even attributed their misfortunes to their own extravagance , and showed no intention of offering them any help .
3 So nothing was left for them but to take their departure to the cottage , which stood in the midst of a dark forest , and seemed to be the most dismal place upon the face of the earth .
4 As they were too poor to have any servants , the girls had to work hard , like peasants , and the sons , for their part , cultivated the fields to earn their living .
5 Roughly clothed , and living in the simplest way , the girls regretted unceasingly the luxuries and amusements of their former life ; only the youngest tried to be brave and cheerful .
6 She had been as sad as anyone when misfortune overtook her father , but , soon recovering her natural gaiety , she set to work to make the best of things , to amuse her father and brothers as well as she could , and to try to persuade her sisters to join her in dancing and singing .
