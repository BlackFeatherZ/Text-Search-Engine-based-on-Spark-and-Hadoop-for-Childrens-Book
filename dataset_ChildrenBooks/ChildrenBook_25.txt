13 Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent , and said : `` I have accepted the crown you have offered me , but only that I may keep it for Prince Darling , who is not dead as you suppose ; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again , good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne .
14 Alas ! ''

17 We may hate his faults , but let us pity him and hope for his restoration .
18 As for me , I would die gladly if that could bring back our Prince to reign justly and worthily once more . ''
19 These words went to Prince Darling 's heart ; he realized the true affection and faithfulness of his old tutor , and for the first time reproached himself for all his evil deeds ; at the same instant he felt all his anger melting away , and he began quickly to think over his past life , and to admit that his punishment was not more than he had deserved .
20 He left off tearing at the iron bars of the cage in which he was shut up , and became as gentle as a lamb .
21 The XXXXX who had caught him took him to a great menagerie , where he was chained up among all the other wild beasts , and he determined to show his sorrow for his past bad behavior by being gentle and obedient to the man who had to take care of him .	hunters		doings|fury|hunters|instant|lake|throne|time|town|ugliness|wolf

1 The Fairy had scarcely finished speaking when Prince Darling saw to his horror that her words were fulfilled .
2 He had a lion 's head , a bull 's horns , a wolf 's feet , and a snake 's body .
3 At the same instant he found himself in a great forest , beside a clear lake , in which he could see plainly the horrible creature he had become , and a voice said to him : `` Look carefully at the state to which your wickedness has brought you ; believe me , your soul is a thousand times more hideous than your body . ''
4 Prince Darling recognized the voice of the Fairy Truth and turned in a fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could ; but he saw no one , and the same voice went on : `` I laugh at your powerlessness and anger , and I intend to punish your pride by letting you fall into the hands of your own subjects . ''
5 The Prince began to think that the best thing he could do would be to get as far away from the lake as he could , then at least he would not be continually reminded of his terrible ugliness .
6 So he ran toward the wood , but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears , and the hunters , who were hiding in a tree , leaped down , and secured him with several chains , and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom .
7 On the way , instead of recognizing that his own faults had brought this punishment upon him , he accused the Fairy of being the cause of all his misfortunes , and bit and tore at his chains furiously .
8 As they approached the town he saw that some great rejoicing was being held , and when the hunters asked what had happened they were told that the Prince , whose only pleasure it was to torment his people , had been found in his room , killed by a thunder-bolt -LRB- for that was what was supposed to have become of him -RRB- .
9 Four of his courtiers , those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings , had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them , but the people , who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the Prince , had cut off their heads , and had offered the crown to Suliman , whom the Prince had left in prison .
10 This noble lord had just been crowned , and the deliverance of the kingdom was the cause of the rejoicing `` For , '' they said , `` he is a good and just man , and we shall once more enjoy peace and prosperity . ''
11 Prince Darling roared with anger when he heard this ; but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace .
12 He saw Suliman seated upon a magnificent throne , and all the people crowded round , wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor .
13 Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent , and said : `` I have accepted the crown you have offered me , but only that I may keep it for Prince Darling , who is not dead as you suppose ; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again , good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne .

1 Four of his courtiers , those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings , had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them , but the people , who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the Prince , had cut off their heads , and had offered the crown to Suliman , whom the Prince had left in prison .

3 Prince Darling roared with anger when he heard this ; but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace .
4 He saw Suliman seated upon a magnificent throne , and all the people crowded round , wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor .
5 Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent , and said : `` I have accepted the crown you have offered me , but only that I may keep it for Prince Darling , who is not dead as you suppose ; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again , good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne .

13 Overcome with gratitude , the keeper stooped to caress the strange creature which had done him such a great service ; but suddenly a voice said in his ear : `` A good action should never go unrewarded , '' and at the same instant the monster disappeared , and he saw at his feet only a pretty little dog !
14 Prince Darling , delighted by the change , frisked about the keeper , showing his joy in every way he could , and the man , taking him up in his arms , carried him to the King , to whom he told the whole story .
15 The Queen said she would like to have this wonderful little dog , and the Prince would have been very happy in his new home if he could have forgotten that he was a man and a king .
16 The Queen petted and took care of him , but she was so afraid that he would get too fat that she consulted the court physician , who said that he was to be fed only upon bread , and was not to have much even of that .

1 `` I would return good for evil , '' he said to himself , `` and save the unhappy man 's life . ''
2 He had hardly wished this when his iron cage flew open , and he rushed to the side of the keeper , who was awake and was defending himself against the tiger .
3 When he saw the monster had got out he gave himself up for lost , but his fear was soon changed into joy , for the kind monster threw itself upon the tiger and very soon killed it , and then came and crouched at the feet of the man it had saved .
4 Overcome with gratitude , the keeper stooped to caress the strange creature which had done him such a great service ; but suddenly a voice said in his ear : `` A good action should never go unrewarded , '' and at the same instant the monster disappeared , and he saw at his feet only a pretty little dog !
5 Prince Darling , delighted by the change , frisked about the keeper , showing his joy in every way he could , and the man , taking him up in his arms , carried him to the King , to whom he told the whole story .
6 The Queen said she would like to have this wonderful little dog , and the Prince would have been very happy in his new home if he could have forgotten that he was a man and a king .
7 The Queen petted and took care of him , but she was so afraid that he would get too fat that she consulted the court physician , who said that he was to be fed only upon bread , and was not to have much even of that .
8 So poor Prince Darling was terribly hungry all day long , but he was very patient about it .
9 One day , when they gave him his little loaf for breakfast , he thought he would like to eat it out in the garden ; so he took it up in his mouth and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of a long way from the palace .
10 But he was surprised to find that the brook was gone , and where it had been stood a great house that seemed to be built of gold and precious stones .
11 Numbers of people splendidly dressed were going into it , and sounds of music and dancing and feasting could be heard from the windows .
12 But what seemed very strange was that those people who came out of the house were pale and thin , and their clothes were torn , and hanging in rags about them .
13 Some fell down dead as they came out before they had time to get away ; others crawled farther with great difficulty ; while others again lay on the ground , fainting with hunger , and begged a morsel of bread from those who were going into the house , but they would not so much as look at the poor creatures .
14 Prince Darling went up to a young girl who was trying to eat a few blades of grass , she was so hungry .
15 Touched with compassion , he said to himself : `` I am very hungry , but I shall not die of starvation before I get my dinner ; if I give my breakfast to this poor creature perhaps I may save her life . ''

20 `` Alas ! ''

6 Some fell down dead as they came out before they had time to get away ; others crawled farther with great difficulty ; while others again lay on the ground , fainting with hunger , and begged a morsel of bread from those who were going into the house , but they would not so much as look at the poor creatures .
7 Prince Darling went up to a young girl who was trying to eat a few blades of grass , she was so hungry .
8 Touched with compassion , he said to himself : `` I am very hungry , but I shall not die of starvation before I get my dinner ; if I give my breakfast to this poor creature perhaps I may save her life . ''
9 So he laid his piece of bread in the girl 's hand , and saw her eat it up eagerly .
10 She soon seemed to be quite well again , and the Prince , delighted to have been able to help her , was thinking of going home to the palace , when he heard a great outcry , and , turning round , saw Celia , who was being carried against her will into the great house .
11 For the first time the Prince regretted that he was no longer the monster , then he would have been able to rescue Celia ; now he could only bark feebly at the people who were carrying her off , and try to follow them , but they chased and kicked him away .
12 He determined not to quit the place till he knew what had become of Celia , and blamed himself for what had befallen her .
13 `` Alas ! ''
14 he said to himself , `` I am furious with the people who are carrying Celia off , but is n't that exactly what I did myself , and if I had not been prevented did I not intend to be still more cruel to her ? ''
15 Here he was interrupted by a noise above his head -- someone was opening a window , and he saw with delight that it was Celia herself , who came forward and threw out a plate of most delicious-looking food , then the window was shut again , and Prince Darling , who had not had anything to eat all day , thought he might as well take the opportunity of getting something .
16 He ran forward to begin , but the young girl to whom he had given his bread gave a cry of terror and took him up in her arms , saying : `` Do n't touch it , my poor little dog -- that house is the palace of pleasure , and everything that comes out of it is poisoned ! ''
17 At the same moment a voice said : `` You see a good action always brings its reward , '' and the Prince found himself changed into a beautiful white dove .
18 He remembered that white was the favorite color of the Fairy Truth , and began to hope that he might at last win back her favor .
19 But just now his first care was for Celia , and rising into the air he flew round and round the house , until he saw an open window ; but he searched through every room in vain .
20 No trace of Celia was to be seen , and the Prince , in despair , determined to search through the world till he found her .

1 So poor Prince Darling was terribly hungry all day long , but he was very patient about it .
2 One day , when they gave him his little loaf for breakfast , he thought he would like to eat it out in the garden ; so he took it up in his mouth and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of a long way from the palace .
3 But he was surprised to find that the brook was gone , and where it had been stood a great house that seemed to be built of gold and precious stones .

1 No trace of Celia was to be seen , and the Prince , in despair , determined to search through the world till he found her .
2 He flew on and on for several days , till he came to a great desert , where he saw a cavern , and , to his delight , there sat Celia , sharing the simple breakfast of an old hermit .
3 Overjoyed to have found her , Prince Darling perched upon her shoulder , trying to express by his caresses how glad he was to see her again , and Celia , surprised and delighted by the tameness of this pretty white dove , stroked it softly , and said , though she never thought of its understanding her : `` I accept the gift that you make me of yourself , and I will love you always . ''
4 `` Take care what you are saying , Celia , '' said the old hermit ; `` are you prepared to keep that promise ? ''
5 `` Indeed , I hope so , my sweet shepherdess , '' cried the Prince , who was at that moment restored to his natural shape .
6 `` You promised to love me always ; tell me that you really mean what you said , or I shall have to ask the Fairy to give me back the form of the dove which pleased you so much . ''
7 `` You need not be afraid that she will change her mind , '' said the Fairy , throwing off the hermit 's robe in which she had been disguised and appearing before them .
8 `` Celia has loved you ever since she first saw you , only she would not tell you while you were so obstinate and naughty .
9 Now you have repented and mean to be good you deserve to be happy , and so she may love you as much as she likes . ''
10 Celia and Prince Darling threw themselves at the Fairy 's feet , and the Prince was never tired of thanking her for her kindness .
11 Celia was delighted to hear how sorry he was for all his past follies and misdeeds , and promised to love him as long as she lived .
12 `` Rise , my children , '' said the Fairy , `` and I will transport you to the palace , and Prince Darling shall have back again the crown he forfeited by his bad behavior . ''
13 While she was speaking , they found themselves in Suliman 's hall , and his delight was great at seeing his dear master once more .
14 He gave up the throne joyfully to the Prince , and remained always the most faithful of his subjects .
15 Celia and Prince Darling reigned for many years , but he was so determined to govern worthily and to do his duty that his ring , which he took to wearing again , never once pricked him severely .

1 Blue Beard , to engage their affection , took them , with the lady their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance , with other young people of the neighborhood , to one of his country seats , where they stayed a whole week .
2 There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure , hunting , fishing , dancing , mirth , and feasting .
3 Nobody went to bed , but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other .
4 In short , everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue , and that he was a mighty civil gentleman .
5 As soon as they returned home , the marriage was concluded .
6 About a month afterward , Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least , about affairs of very great consequence , desiring her to divert herself in his absence , to send for her friends and acquaintances , to carry them into the country , if she pleased , and to make good cheer wherever she was .
7 `` Here , '' said he , `` are the keys of the two great wardrobes , wherein I have my best furniture ; these are of my silver and gold plate , which is not every day in use ; these open my strong boxes , which hold my money , both gold and silver ; these my caskets of jewels ; and this is the master-key to all my apartments .
8 But for this little one here , it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor .
9 Open them all ; go into all and every one of them , except that little closet , which I forbid you , and forbid it in such a manner that , if you happen to open it , there 's nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment . ''
10 She promised to observe , very exactly , whatever he had ordered ; when he , after having embraced her , got into his coach and proceeded on his journey .
11 Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady , so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house , not daring to come while her husband was there , because of his blue beard , which frightened them .
12 They ran through all the rooms , closets , and wardrobes , which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another .
13 After that they went up into the two great rooms , where was the best and richest furniture ; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry , beds , couches , cabinets , stands , tables , and looking-glasses , in which you might see yourself from head to foot ; some of them were framed with glass , others with silver , plain and gilded , the finest and most magnificent ever were seen .
14 They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend , who in the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things , because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor .
15 She was so much pressed by her curiosity that , without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company , she went down a little back staircase , and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck .
16 Coming to the closet-door , she made a stop for some time , thinking upon her husband 's orders , and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient ; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it .
17 She then took the little key , and opened it , trembling , but could not at first see anything plainly , because the windows were shut .

1 As soon as they returned home , the marriage was concluded .
2 About a month afterward , Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least , about affairs of very great consequence , desiring her to divert herself in his absence , to send for her friends and acquaintances , to carry them into the country , if she pleased , and to make good cheer wherever she was .
3 `` Here , '' said he , `` are the keys of the two great wardrobes , wherein I have my best furniture ; these are of my silver and gold plate , which is not every day in use ; these open my strong boxes , which hold my money , both gold and silver ; these my caskets of jewels ; and this is the master-key to all my apartments .

5 Open them all ; go into all and every one of them , except that little closet , which I forbid you , and forbid it in such a manner that , if you happen to open it , there 's nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment . ''
6 She promised to observe , very exactly , whatever he had ordered ; when he , after having embraced her , got into his coach and proceeded on his journey .
7 Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady , so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house , not daring to come while her husband was there , because of his blue beard , which frightened them .
8 They ran through all the rooms , closets , and wardrobes , which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another .
9 After that they went up into the two great rooms , where was the best and richest furniture ; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry , beds , couches , cabinets , stands , tables , and looking-glasses , in which you might see yourself from head to foot ; some of them were framed with glass , others with silver , plain and gilded , the finest and most magnificent ever were seen .
10 They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend , who in the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things , because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor .
11 She was so much pressed by her curiosity that , without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company , she went down a little back staircase , and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck .
12 Coming to the closet-door , she made a stop for some time , thinking upon her husband 's orders , and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient ; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it .
13 She then took the little key , and opened it , trembling , but could not at first see anything plainly , because the windows were shut .
14 After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood , on which lay the bodies of several dead women , ranged against the walls .

10 Then Trusty John answered : `` I will never desert him , and will serve him faithfully , even though it should cost me my life . ''

12 When he beholds that picture he will fall violently in love with it and go off into a dead faint , and for her sake he will encounter many dangers ; you must guard him from this . ''
13 And when Trusty John had again given the King his hand upon it the old man became silent , laid his head on the pillow , and died .
14 When the old King had been carried to his grave Trusty John told the young King what he had promised his father on his death-bed , and added : `` And I shall assuredly keep my word , and shall be faithful to you as I have been to him , even though it should cost me my life . ''
15 Now when the time of mourning was over , Trusty John said to him : `` It is time you should see your inheritance .
16 I will show you your ancestral castle . ''
17 So he took him over everything , and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments , only the one room where the picture was he did not open .
18 But the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it , and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved , and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world .
19 But the young King noticed that Trusty John always missed one door , and said : `` Why do you never open this one for me ? ''
20 `` There is something inside that would appall you , '' he answered .

5 So he took him over everything , and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments , only the one room where the picture was he did not open .
6 But the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it , and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved , and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world .
7 But the young King noticed that Trusty John always missed one door , and said : `` Why do you never open this one for me ? ''
8 `` There is something inside that would appall you , '' he answered .
9 But the King replied : `` I have seen the whole castle , and shall find out what is in there '' ; and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open .
10 But Trusty John held him back , and said : `` I promised your father before his death that you should n't see what that room contains .
11 It might bring both you and me to great grief . ''
12 `` Ah !
13 no , '' answered the young King ; `` if I do n't get in , it will be my certain destruction ; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what was in the room with my own eyes .
14 Now I do n't budge from the spot till you have opened the door . ''
15 Then Trusty John saw there was no way out of it , so with a heavy heart and many sighs he took the key from the big bunch .
16 When he had opened the door he stepped in first , and thought to cover the likeness so that the King might not perceive it ; but it was hopeless : the King stood on tiptoe and looked over his shoulder .
17 And when he saw the picture of the maid , so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones , he fell swooning to the ground .
18 Trusty John lifted him up , carried him to bed , and thought sorrowfully : `` The curse has come upon us ; gracious heaven !
19 what will be the end of it all ? ''
20 Then he poured wine down his throat till he came to himself again .

1 Now it happened one day , while they were sailing on the high seas , that Trusty John , sitting on the forepart of the ship , fiddling away to himself , observed three ravens in the air flying toward him .
2 He ceased playing , and listened to what they were saying , for he understood their language .

5 `` Yes , '' answered the second , `` but he 's not got her yet . ''
6 `` Yes , he has , '' spake the third , `` for she 's sitting beside him on the ship . ''
7 Then number one began again and cried : `` That 'll not help him !
8 When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them : the King will wish to mount it , and if he does it will gallop away with him , and disappear into the air , and he will never see his bride again . ''

11 `` Oh !
12 yes , if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster , then the young King is saved .
13 But who 's to do that ?
14 And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees . ''
15 Then spake number two : `` I know more than that : even if the horse is slain , the young King will still not keep his bride : when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard , which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver , but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar : when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones .

2 But the King spake : `` Silence !
3 let him alone ; he is ever my most trusty John .
4 Who knows for what good end he may have done this thing ? ''
5 So they went on their way and entered the palace , and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the ready-made bridal shirt , looking for all the world as though it were made of gold and silver .
6 The young King went toward it and was about to take hold of it , but Trusty John , pushing him aside , seized it with his gloved hands , threw it hastily into the fire , and let it burn The other servants commenced grumbling again , and said : `` See , he 's actually burning the King 's bridal shirt . ''
7 But the young King spoke : `` Who knows for what good purpose he does it ?
8 Let him alone , he is my most trusty John . ''
9 Then the wedding was celebrated , the dance began , and the bride joined in , but Trusty John watched her countenance carefully .
10 Of a sudden she grew deadly white , and fell to the ground as if she were dead .
11 He at once sprang hastily toward her , lifted her up , and bore her to a room , where he laid her down , and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side , and spat them out .
12 She soon breathed again and came to herself ; but the young King had watched the proceeding , and not knowing why Trusty John had acted as he did , he flew into a passion , and cried : `` Throw him into prison . ''
13 On the following morning sentence was passed on Trusty John , and he was condemned to be hanged .
14 As he stood on the gallows he said : `` Every one doomed to death has the right to speak once before he dies ; and I too have that privilege ? ''
15 `` Yes , '' said the King , `` it shall be granted to you . ''
16 So Trusty John spoke : `` I am unjustly condemned , for I have always been faithful to you '' ; and he proceeded to relate how he had heard the ravens ' conversation on the sea , and how he had to do all he did in order to save his master .
17 Then the King cried : `` Oh !
18 my most trusty John , pardon !
19 pardon !
20 Take him down . ''

15 And the King cried out : `` All I have in the world will I give up for your sake . ''

14 THE BRAVE LITTLE TAILOR One summer 's day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in the best of spirits , and sewed for dear life .
15 As he was sitting thus a peasant woman came down the street , calling out : `` Good jam to sell , good jam to sell . ''
16 This sounded sweetly in the tailor 's ears ; he put his frail little head out of the window , and shouted : `` up here , my good woman , and you 'll find a willing customer . ''
17 The woman climbed up the three flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor 's room , and he made her spread out all the pots in a row before him .
18 He examined them all , lifted them up and smelled them , and said at last : `` This jam seems good , weigh me four ounces of it , my good woman ; and even if it 's a quarter of a pound I wo n't stick at it . ''
19 The woman , who had hoped to find a good market , gave him what he wanted , but went away grumbling wrathfully .
20 `` Now heaven shall bless this jam for my use , '' cried the little tailor , `` and it shall sustain and strengthen me . ''
21 He fetched some bread out of a cupboard , cut a round off the loaf , and spread the XXXXX on it .	jam		account|bodies|church|ears|hand|jam|nothing|ounces|sons|woman

3 Then the King was full of joy , and when he saw the Queen coming , he hid Trusty John and the two children in a big cupboard .
4 As she entered he said to her : `` Did you pray in church ? ''
5 `` Yes , '' she answered , `` but my thoughts dwelt constantly on Trusty John , and of what he has suffered for us . ''

2 He fetched some bread out of a cupboard , cut a round off the loaf , and spread the jam on it .
3 `` That wo n't taste amiss , '' he said ; `` but I 'll finish that waistcoat first before I take a bite . ''
4 He placed the bread beside him , went on sewing , and out of the lightness of his heart kept on making his stitches bigger and bigger .
5 In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to the ceiling , where heaps of flies were sitting , and attracted them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses .
6 `` Ha !
7 who invited you ? ''

10 At last the little tailor , losing all patience , reached out of his chimney corner for a duster , and exclaiming : `` Wait , and I 'll give it to you , '' he beat them mercilessly with it .

14 `` The whole town must know about this '' ; and in great haste the little tailor cut out a girdle , hemmed it , and embroidered on it in big letters , `` Seven at a blow . ''
15 `` What did I say , the town ?
16 no , the whole world shall hear of it , '' he said ; and his heart beat for joy as a lamb wags his tail .
17 The tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into the wide world , for he considered his workroom too small a field for his prowess .
18 Before he set forth he looked round about him , to see if there was anything in the house he could take with him on his journey ; but he found nothing except an old cheese , which he took possession of .
