3 I answered in few words , but in the most submissive manner ; and , being almost famished with hunger , I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth , to signify that I wanted food .
4 He understood me very well , and , descending from the stage , commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides , on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted , and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food , which had been sent by the King 's orders when he first received tidings of me .
5 There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark .
6 I ate them two or three at a mouthful , and took three loaves at a time .
7 They supplied me as fast as they could , with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite .
8 I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink .
9 They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me , and , being a most ingenious people , they slung up one of their largest hogsheads , then rolled it toward my hand , and beat out the top .
10 I drank it off at a draught , which I might well do , for it did not hold half a pint .
11 They brought me a second hogshead , which I drank , and made signs for more ; but they had none to give me .
12 However , I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals , who ventured to mount and walk upon my body , while one of my hands was free , without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them .
13 After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty .
14 His Excellency , having mounted my right leg , advanced to my face , with about a dozen of his retinue , and spoke about ten minutes , often pointing forward , which , as I afterward found , was toward the capital city , about half a mile distant , whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed .
15 I made a sign with my hand that was loose , putting it to the other -LRB- but over his Excellency 's head , for fear of hurting him or his train -RRB- , to show that I desired my liberty .
16 He seemed to understand me well enough , for he shook his head , though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough , and very good treatment .
17 Then I once more thought of attempting to escape ; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands , which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased , I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased .
18 Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment , which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows .
19 The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy , and presently I fell asleep .
20 I slept about eight hours , as I was told afterward ; and it was no wonder , for the physicians , by the Emperor 's orders , had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine .
21 It seems that , when I was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing , the Emperor had early notice of it , and determined that I should be tied in the XXXXX I have related -LRB- which was done in the night , while I slept -RRB- , that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me , and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city .	manner		Excellency|body|enemies|foot|head|impatience|legs|liberty|manner|mortals

1 Then , turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me , I saw a stage set up , about a foot and a half from the ground , with two or three ladders to mount it .
2 From this , one of them , who seemed to be a person of quality , made me a long speech , of which I could not understand a word , though I could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me , and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness .

4 Then I once more thought of attempting to escape ; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands , which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased , I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased .
5 Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment , which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows .
6 The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy , and presently I fell asleep .
7 I slept about eight hours , as I was told afterward ; and it was no wonder , for the physicians , by the Emperor 's orders , had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine .

9 Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set to work to prepare the engine .
10 It was a frame of wood , raised three inches from the ground , about seven feet long and four wide , moving upon twenty-two wheels .
11 But the difficulty was to place me on it .
12 Eighty poles were erected for this purpose , and very strong cords fastened to bandages which the workmen had tied round my neck , hands , body , and legs .
13 Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by pulleys fastened on the poles , and in less than three hours I was raised and slung into the engine , and there tied fast .
14 Fifteen hundred of the Emperor 's largest horses , each about four inches and a half high , were then employed to draw me toward the capital .
15 But while all this was done I still lay in a deep sleep , and I did not wake till four hours after we began our journey .
16 The Emperor and all his Court came out to meet us when we reached the capital ; but his great officials would not suffer his Majesty to risk his person by mounting on my body .
17 Where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple , supposed to be the largest in the whole kingdom , and here it was determined that I should lodge .
18 Near the great gate , through which I could easily creep , they fixed ninety-one chains , like those which hang to a lady 's watch , which were locked to my left leg with thirty-six padlocks ; and when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose , they cut all the strings that bound me .
19 Then I rose up , feeling as melancholy as ever I did in my life .
20 But the noise and astonishment of the people on seeing me rise and walk were inexpressible .
21 The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long , and gave me not only freedom to walk backward and forward in a semicircle , but to creep in and lie at full length inside the XXXXX .	temple		blisters|carriage|face|number|ointment|people|poles|temple|wake|watch

5 Six hundred servants were appointed me , and three hundred tailors made me a suit of clothes .
6 Moreover , six of his Majesty 's greatest scholars were employed to teach me their language , so that soon I was able to converse after a fashion with the Emperor , who often honored me with his visits .
7 The first words I learned were to desire that he would please to give me my liberty , which I every day repeated on my knees ; but he answered that this must be a work of time , and that first I must swear a peace with him and his kingdom .
8 He told me also that by the laws of the nation I must be searched by two of his officers , and that as this could not be done without my help , he trusted them in my hands , and whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country .
9 I took up the two officers , and put them into my coat pockets .
10 These gentlemen , having pen , ink , and paper about them , made an exact list of everything they saw , which I afterward translated into English , and which ran as follows : `` In the right coat pocket of the great Man-Mountain we found only one great piece of coarse cloth , large enough to cover the carpet of your Majesty 's chief room of state .
11 In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest , with a silver cover , which we could not lift .
12 We desired that it should be opened , and one of us stepping into it found himself up to the mid-leg in a sort of dust , some of which flying into our faces sent us both into a fit of sneezing .
13 In his right waistcoat pocket we found a number of white thin substances , folded one over another , about the size of three men , tied with a strong cable , and marked with black figures , which we humbly conceive to be writings .
14 In the left there was a sort of engine , from the back of which extended twenty long poles , with which , we conjecture , the Man-Mountain combs his head .
15 In the smaller pocket on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal , of different sizes .
16 Some of the white , which appeared to be silver , were so large and heavy that my comrade and I could hardly lift them .
17 From another pocket hung a huge silver chain , with a wonderful kind of engine fastened to it , a globe half silver and half of some transparent metal ; for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures , and thought we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by the shining substance .
18 This engine made an incessant noise , like a water-mill , and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal , or the god he worships , but probably the latter , for he told us that he seldom did anything without consulting it .

20 I had one private pocket which escaped their search , containing a pair of spectacles and a small spy-glass , which , being of no consequence to the Emperor , I did not think myself bound in honor to discover .

3 He began with compliments on my liberty , but he added that , save for the present state of things at Court , perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon .
4 `` For , '' he said , `` however flourishing we may seem to foreigners , we are in danger of an invasion from the island of Blefuscu , which is the other great empire of the universe , almost as large and as powerful as this of his Majesty .
5 For as to what we have heard you say , that there are other kingdoms in the world , inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself , our philosophers are very doubtful , and rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon , or one of the stars , because a hundred mortals of your size would soon destroy all the fruit and cattle of his Majesty 's dominions .
6 Besides , our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two mighty empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu , which , as I was going to tell you , are engaged in a most obstinate war , which began in the following manner : It is allowed on all hands that the primitive way of breaking eggs was upon the larger end ; but his present Majesty 's grandfather , while he was a boy , going to eat an egg , and breaking it according to the ancient practice , happened to cut one of his fingers .
7 Whereupon the Emperor , his father , made a law commanding all his subjects to break the smaller end of their eggs .

17 I then came back to my house and gave orders for a great quantity of the strongest cables and bars of iron .
18 The cable was about as thick as packthread , and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle .

20 Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables , I went back to the coast , and taking off my coat , shoes , and stockings , walked into the sea in my leather jacket about half an hour before high water .

5 CHAPTER IV It was not long before I communicated to his Majesty the plan I formed for seizing the enemy 's whole fleet .
6 The Empire of Blefuscu is an island parted from Lilliput only by a channel eight hundred yards wide .
7 I consulted the most experienced seamen on the depth of the channel , and they told me that in the middle , at high water , it was seventy glumguffs -LRB- about six feet of European measure -RRB- .
8 I walked toward the coast , where , lying down behind a hillock , I took out my spy-glass , and viewed the enemy 's fleet at anchor -- about fifty men-of-war , and other vessels .
9 I then came back to my house and gave orders for a great quantity of the strongest cables and bars of iron .
10 The cable was about as thick as packthread , and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle .
11 I trebled the cable to make it stronger , and for the same reason twisted three of the iron bars together , bending the ends into a hook .
12 Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables , I went back to the coast , and taking off my coat , shoes , and stockings , walked into the sea in my leather jacket about half an hour before high water .
13 I waded with what haste I could , swimming in the middle about thirty yards , till I felt ground , and thus arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour .
14 The enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam ashore , where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand .
15 Then , fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship , I tied all the cords together at the end .
16 Meanwhile the enemy discharged several thousand arrows , many of which stuck in my hands and face .
17 My greatest fear was for my eyes , which I should have lost if I had not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the Emperor 's searchers .
18 These I took out and fastened upon my nose , and thus armed went on with my work in spite of the arrows , many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles , but without any other effect than slightly disturbing them .
19 Then , taking the knot in my hand , I began to pull ; but not a ship would stir , for they were too fast held by their anchors .
20 Thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained .
21 Letting go the cord , I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors , receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and XXXXX .	hands		cables|coat|depth|enterprise|ground|hand|hands|hook|island|middle

7 I waded with what haste I could , swimming in the middle about thirty yards , till I felt ground , and thus arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour .
8 The enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their ships and swam ashore , where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand .
9 Then , fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship , I tied all the cords together at the end .
10 Meanwhile the enemy discharged several thousand arrows , many of which stuck in my hands and face .
11 My greatest fear was for my eyes , which I should have lost if I had not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the Emperor 's searchers .
12 These I took out and fastened upon my nose , and thus armed went on with my work in spite of the arrows , many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles , but without any other effect than slightly disturbing them .
13 Then , taking the knot in my hand , I began to pull ; but not a ship would stir , for they were too fast held by their anchors .
14 Thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained .
15 Letting go the cord , I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors , receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and hands .
16 Then I took up again the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied , and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy 's largest men-of-war after me .
17 When the Blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order , and me pulling at the end , they set up a scream of grief and despair that it is impossible to describe .
18 When I had got out of danger I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face , and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival .

11 The Emperor concluded that I was drowned , and that the enemy 's fleet was approaching in a hostile manner .
12 But he was soon set at ease , for , the channel growing shallower every step I made , I came in a short time within hearing , and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened , I cried in a loud voice : `` Long live the most puissant Emperor of Lilliput ! ''
13 The Prince received me at my landing with all possible joy , and made me a Nardal on the spot , which is the highest title of honor among them .
14 His Majesty desired that I would take some opportunity to bring all the rest of his enemy 's ships into his ports , and seemed to think of nothing less than conquering the whole Empire of Blefuscu , and becoming the sole monarch of the world .
15 But I plainly protested that I would never be the means of bringing a free and brave people into slavery ; and though the wisest of the Ministers were of my opinion , my open refusal was so opposed to his Majesty 's ambition that he could never forgive me .
16 And from this time a plot began between himself and those of his Ministers who were my enemies , that nearly ended in my utter destruction .
17 About three weeks after this exploit there arrived an embassy from Blefuscu , with humble offers of peace , which was soon concluded , on terms very advantageous to our Emperor .
18 There were six ambassadors , with a train of about five hundred persons , all very magnificent .
19 Having been privately told that I had befriended them , they made me a visit , and paying me many compliments on my valor and generosity , invited me to their kingdom in the Emperor their master 's name .
20 I asked them to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master , whose royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country .
21 Accordingly , the next time I had the honor to see our Emperor I desired his general permission to visit the Blefuscudian XXXXX .	monarch		Court|Empire|kingdom|middle|monarch|ship|ships|spot|tide|visit

1 Then , taking the knot in my hand , I began to pull ; but not a ship would stir , for they were too fast held by their anchors .
2 Thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained .
3 Letting go the cord , I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors , receiving more than two hundred shots in my face and hands .
4 Then I took up again the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied , and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy 's largest men-of-war after me .
5 When the Blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order , and me pulling at the end , they set up a scream of grief and despair that it is impossible to describe .
6 When I had got out of danger I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face , and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival .
7 I then took off my spectacles , and after waiting about an hour , till the tide was a little fallen , I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput .

1 I then took off my spectacles , and after waiting about an hour , till the tide was a little fallen , I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput .
2 The Emperor and his whole Court stood on the shore awaiting me .
3 They saw the ships move forward in a large half-moon , but could not discern me , who , in the middle of the channel , was under water up to my neck .
4 The Emperor concluded that I was drowned , and that the enemy 's fleet was approaching in a hostile manner .
5 But he was soon set at ease , for , the channel growing shallower every step I made , I came in a short time within hearing , and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened , I cried in a loud voice : `` Long live the most puissant Emperor of Lilliput ! ''
6 The Prince received me at my landing with all possible joy , and made me a Nardal on the spot , which is the highest title of honor among them .
7 His Majesty desired that I would take some opportunity to bring all the rest of his enemy 's ships into his ports , and seemed to think of nothing less than conquering the whole Empire of Blefuscu , and becoming the sole monarch of the world .

13 I asked them to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master , whose royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country .

10 And the secretary , humbly desiring to be heard again , said that as to expense your allowance might be gradually lessened , so that , for want of sufficient food you should grow weak and faint , and die in a few months , when his Majesty 's subjects might cut your flesh from your bones and bury it , leaving the skeleton for the admiration of posterity .

18 At last , having his Majesty 's leave to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu , I resolved to take this opportunity .
19 Before the three days had passed I wrote a letter to my friend the secretary telling him of my resolution ; and , without waiting for an answer , went to the coast , and entering the channel , between wading and swimming reached the port of Blefuscu , where the people , who had long expected me , led me to the capital .

1 I returned immediately to the city for help , and after a huge amount of labor I managed to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu , where a great crowd of people appeared , full of wonder at sight of so prodigious a vessel .
2 I told the Emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way to carry me to some place whence I might return to my native country , and begged his orders for materials to fit it up , and leave to depart -- which , after many kindly speeches , he was pleased to grant .
3 Meanwhile the Emperor of Lilliput , uneasy at my long absence -LRB- but never imagining that I had the least notice of his designs -RRB- , sent a person of rank to inform the Emperor of Blefuscu of my disgrace ; this messenger had orders to represent the great mercy of his master , who was content to punish me with the loss of my eyes , and who expected that his brother of Blefuscu would have me sent back to Lilliput , bound hand and foot , to be punished as a traitor .
4 The Emperor of Blefuscu answered with many civil excuses .
5 He said that as for sending me bound , his brother knew it was impossible .
6 Moreover , though I had taken away his fleet he was grateful to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace .
7 But that both their Majesties would soon be made easy ; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore , able to carry me on the sea , which he had given orders to fit up ; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires would be free from me .
8 With this answer the messenger returned to Lilliput ; and I -LRB- though the monarch of Blefuscu secretly offered me his gracious protection if I would continue in his service -RRB- hastened my departure , resolving never more to put confidence in princes .
9 In about a month I was ready to take leave .
10 The Emperor of Blefuscu , with the Empress and the royal family , came out of the palace ; and I lay down on my face to kiss their hands , which they graciously gave me .
11 His Majesty presented me with fifty purses of sprugs -LRB- their greatest gold coin -RRB- and his picture at full length , which I put immediately into one of my gloves , to keep it from being hurt .
12 Many other ceremonies took place at my departure .
13 I stored the boat with meat and drink , and took six cows and two bulls alive , with as many ewes and rams , intending to carry them into my own country ; and to feed them on board , I had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn .
14 I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives ; but this was a thing the Emperor would by no means permit , and besides a diligent search into my pockets , his Majesty pledged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects , though with their own consent and desire .
15 Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able , I set sail .
16 When I had made twenty-four leagues , by my reckoning , from the island of Blefuscu , I saw a sail steering to the northeast .
17 I hailed her , but could get no answer ; yet I found I gained upon her , for the wind slackened ; and in half an hour she spied me , and discharged a gun .

16 THE PRINCESS ON THE GLASS HILL Once upon a time there was a man who had a meadow which lay on the side of a mountain , and in the meadow there was a barn in which he stored hay .
17 But there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years , for every St. John 's eve , when the grass was in the height of its vigor , it was all eaten clean up , just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed it down to the ground during the night .
18 This happened once , and it happened twice , but then the man got tired of losing his crop , and said to his sons -- he had three of them , and the third was called Cinderlad -- that one of them must go and sleep in the barn on St. John 's night , for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again , blade and stalk , as it had been the last two years , and the one who went to watch must keep a sharp look-out , the man said .
19 The eldest was quite willing to go to the meadow ; he would watch the grass , he said , and he would do it so well that neither man , nor beast , nor even the devil himself should have any of it .
20 So when evening came he went to the barn , and lay down to sleep , but when night was drawing near there was such a rumbling and such an earthquake that the walls and roof shook again , and the lad jumped up and took to his heels as fast as he could , and never even looked back , and the barn remained empty that year just as it had been for the last two .

1 We arrived in England on the 13th of April , 1702 .
2 I stayed two months with my wife and family ; but my eager desire to see foreign countries would suffer me to remain no longer .
3 However , while in England I made great profit by showing my cattle to persons of quality and others ; and before I began my second voyage I sold them for 600_l .
4 I left 1500_l .
5 with my wife , and fixed her in a good house ; then taking leave of her and my boy and girl , with tears on both sides , I sailed on board the `` Adventure . ''

7 THE PRINCESS ON THE GLASS HILL Once upon a time there was a man who had a meadow which lay on the side of a mountain , and in the meadow there was a barn in which he stored hay .
8 But there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years , for every St. John 's eve , when the grass was in the height of its vigor , it was all eaten clean up , just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed it down to the ground during the night .
9 This happened once , and it happened twice , but then the man got tired of losing his crop , and said to his sons -- he had three of them , and the third was called Cinderlad -- that one of them must go and sleep in the barn on St. John 's night , for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again , blade and stalk , as it had been the last two years , and the one who went to watch must keep a sharp look-out , the man said .

2 So when evening came he went to the barn , and lay down to sleep , but when night was drawing near there was such a rumbling and such an earthquake that the walls and roof shook again , and the lad jumped up and took to his heels as fast as he could , and never even looked back , and the barn remained empty that year just as it had been for the last two .
3 Next St. John 's eve the man again said that he could not go on in this way , losing all the grass in the outlying field year after year , and that one of his sons must just go there and watch it , and watch well too .

18 `` Well , so I have , '' said Cinderlad .
19 So they went there again , and there the grass was , standing as high and as thick as it had been before , but that did not make them any kinder to Cinderlad .
20 When the third St. John 's night came neither of the two elder brothers dared to lie in the outlying barn to watch the grass , for they had been so heartily frightened the night that they had slept there that they could not get over it , but Cinderlad dared to go , and everything happened just the same as on the two former nights .
21 There were three earthquakes , each worse than the other , and the last flung the boy from one wall of the barn to the other , but then XXXXX suddenly became still as death .	everything		St.|death|everything|field|grass|haste|lamb|one|place|power

1 it is thou who eatest up our hay then , '' thought the boy ; `` but I will stop that . ''
2 So he made haste , and took out his steel for striking fire , and threw it over the horse , and then it had no power to stir from the spot , and became so tame that the boy could do what he liked with it .
3 So he mounted it and rode away to a place which no one knew of but himself , and there he tied it up .
4 When he went home again his brothers laughed and asked how he had got on .
5 `` You did n't lie long in the barn , if even you have been so far as the field ! ''
6 said they .
7 `` I lay in the barn till the sun rose , but I saw nothing and heard nothing , not I , '' said the boy .
8 `` God knows what there was to make you two so frightened . ''
9 `` Well , we shall soon see whether you have watched the meadow or not , '' answered the brothers , but when they got there the grass was all standing just as long and as thick as it had been the night before .
10 The next St. John 's eve it was the same thing , once again : neither of the two brothers dared to go to the outlying field to watch the crop , but Cinderlad went , and everything happened exactly the same as on the previous St. John 's eve : first there was a rumbling and an earthquake , and then there was another , and then a third : but all three earthquakes were much , very much more violent than they had been the year before .
11 Then everything became still as death again , and the boy heard something chewing outside the barn door , so he stole as softly as he could to the door , which was slightly ajar , and again there was a horse standing close by the wall of the house , eating and chewing , and it was far larger and fatter than the first horse , and it had a saddle on its back , and a bridle was on it too , and a full suit of armor for a knight , all of bright silver , and as beautiful as anyone could wish to see .
12 `` Ho , ho ! ''
13 thought the boy , `` is it thou who eatest up our hay in the night ?
14 but I will put a stop to that . ''
15 So he took out his steel for striking fire , and threw it over the horse 's mane , and the beast stood there as quiet as a lamb .
16 Then the boy rode this horse , too , away to the place where he kept the other , and then went home again .
17 `` I suppose you will tell us that you have watched well again this time , '' said the brothers .
