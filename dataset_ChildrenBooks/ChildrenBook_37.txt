2 By-and-by the boys came in sight , but this time there were only two of them , as the youngest had stayed at home .
3 The air was warm and damp , and the snow soft and slushy , and the elder brother 's bowstring hung loose , while the bow of the younger caught in a tree and snapped in half .
4 At that moment the dogs began to bark loudly , and the bear rushed out of the thicket and set off in the direction of the mountain .
5 Without thinking that they had nothing to defend themselves with , should the bear turn and attack them , the boys gave chase .
6 The bear , who knew quite well that he could not be shot , sometimes slackened his pace and let the dogs get quite close ; and in this way the elder son reached the mountain without observing it , while his brother , who had hurt his foot , was still far behind .
7 As he ran up , the mountain opened to admit the bear , and the boy , who was close on his heels , rushed in after him , and did not know where he was till he saw bears sitting on every side of him , holding a council .
8 The animal he had been chasing sank panting in their midst , and the boy , very much frightened , stood still , letting his bow fall to the ground .
9 ` Why are you trying to kill all my servants ? '
10 asked the chief .
11 ` Look round and see their shades , with arrows sticking in them .
12 It was I who told the bear to-day how he was to lure you into my power .
13 I shall take care that you shall not hurt my people any more , because you will become a bear yourself . '
14 At this moment the second brother came up -- for the mountain had been left open on purpose to tempt him also -- and cried out breathlessly : ` Do n't you see that the bear is lying close to you ?
15 Why do n't you shoot him ? '
16 And , without waiting for a reply , pressed forward to drive his arrow into the heart of the bear .
17 But the elder one caught his raised arm , and whispered : ` Be quiet !
18 ca n't you tell where you are ? '
19 Then the boy looked up and saw the angry bears about him .
20 On the one side were the servants of the chief , and on the other the servants of the chief 's sister , who was sorry for the two youths , and begged that their lives might be spared .

6 On the one side were the servants of the chief , and on the other the servants of the chief 's sister , who was sorry for the two youths , and begged that their lives might be spared .
7 The chief answered that he would not kill them , but only cast a spell over them , by which their heads and bodies should remain as they were , but their arms and legs should change into those of a bear , so that they would go on all fours for the rest of their lives .
8 And , stooping over a spring of water , he dipped a handful of moss in it and rubbed it over the arms and legs of the boys .
9 In an instant the transformation took place , and two creatures , neither beast nor human stood before the chief .
10 Now the bear chief of course knew that the boys ' father would seek for his sons when they did not return home , so he sent another of his servants to the hiding-place at the fork of the trail to see what would happen .
11 He had not waited long , when the father came in sight , stooping as he went to look for his sons ' tracks in the snow .
12 When he saw the marks of snow-shoes along the path on the right he was filled with joy , not knowing that the servant had made some fresh tracks on purpose to mislead him ; and he hastened forward so fast that he fell headlong into a pit , where the bear was sitting .
13 Before he could pick himself up the bear had quietly broken his neck , and , hiding the body under the snow , sat down to see if anyone else would pass that way .
14 Meanwhile the mother at home was wondering what had become of her two sons , and as the hours went on , and their father never returned , she made up her mind to go and look for him .
15 The youngest boy begged her to let him undertake the search , but she would not hear of it , and told him he must stay at home and take care of his sister .
16 So , slipping on her snow-shoes , she started on her way .
17 As no fresh snow had fallen , the trail was quite easy to find , and she walked straight on , till it led her up to the pit where the bear was waiting for her .
18 He grasped her as she fell and broke her neck , after which he laid her in the snow beside her husband , and went back to tell the bear chief .
19 Hour after hour dragged heavily by in the forest hut , and at last the brother and sister felt quite sure that in some way or other all the rest of the family had perished .
20 Day after day the boy climbed to the top of a tall tree near the house , and sat there till he was almost frozen , looking on all sides through the forest openings , hoping that he might see someone coming along .
21 Very soon all the food in the XXXXX was eaten , and he knew he would have to go out and hunt for more .	house		arm|arms|bears|heart|house|lives|marks|rest|sister|tree

19 But somehow his spells could not have worked properly that day , as the bear chief did not know that Redmouth had gone with his master , or he would have been more careful .
20 For the moment the dog ran round the bushes barking loudly , the little bear servant rushed out in a fright , and set out for the mountains as fast as he could .
21 The XXXXX followed the bear , and the boy followed the dog , until the mountain , the house of the great bear chief , came in sight .	dog		Whereupon|brother|dog|food|home|hut|neck|time|top|way

3 So , slipping on her snow-shoes , she started on her way .
4 As no fresh snow had fallen , the trail was quite easy to find , and she walked straight on , till it led her up to the pit where the bear was waiting for her .
5 He grasped her as she fell and broke her neck , after which he laid her in the snow beside her husband , and went back to tell the bear chief .
6 Hour after hour dragged heavily by in the forest hut , and at last the brother and sister felt quite sure that in some way or other all the rest of the family had perished .
7 Day after day the boy climbed to the top of a tall tree near the house , and sat there till he was almost frozen , looking on all sides through the forest openings , hoping that he might see someone coming along .
8 Very soon all the food in the house was eaten , and he knew he would have to go out and hunt for more .
9 Besides , he wished to seek for his parents .
10 The little girl did not like being left alone in the hut , and cried bitterly ; but her brother told her that there was no use sitting down quietly to starve , and that whether he found any game or not he would certainly be back before the following night .
11 Then he cut himself some arrows , each from a different tree , and winged with the feathers of four different birds .
12 He then made himself a bow , very light and strong , and got down his snow-shoes .
13 All this took some time , and he could not start that day , but early next morning he called his little dog Redmouth , whom he kept in a box , and set out .
14 After he had followed the trail for a great distance he grew very tired , and sat upon the branch of a tree to rest .
15 But Redmouth barked so furiously that the boy thought that perhaps his parents might have been killed under its branches , and stepping back , shot one of his arrows at the root of the tree .
16 Whereupon a noise like thunder shook it from top to bottom , fire broke out , and in a few minutes a little heap of ashes lay in the place where it had stood .
17 Not knowing quite what to make of it all , the boy continued on the trail , and went down the right-hand fork till he came to the clump of bushes where the bears used to hide .
18 Now , as was plain by his being able to change the shape of the two brothers , the bear chief knew a good deal of magic , and he was quite aware that the little boy was following the trail , and he sent a very small but clever bear servant to wait for him in the bushes and to try to tempt him into the mountain .
19 But somehow his spells could not have worked properly that day , as the bear chief did not know that Redmouth had gone with his master , or he would have been more careful .
20 For the moment the dog ran round the bushes barking loudly , the little bear servant rushed out in a fright , and set out for the mountains as fast as he could .
21 The dog followed the XXXXX , and the boy followed the dog , until the mountain , the house of the great bear chief , came in sight .	bear		bear|birds|box|distance|girl|house|hut|moment|root|sides

16 Now , as was plain by his being able to change the shape of the two brothers , the bear chief knew a good deal of magic , and he was quite aware that the little boy was following the trail , and he sent a very small but clever bear servant to wait for him in the bushes and to try to tempt him into the mountain .

20 But along the road the snow was so wet and heavy that the boy could hardly get along , and then the thong of his snow-shoes broke , and he had to stop and mend it , so that the bear and the dog got so far ahead that he could scarcely hear the barking .

1 So , slipping on her snow-shoes , she started on her way .
2 As no fresh snow had fallen , the trail was quite easy to find , and she walked straight on , till it led her up to the pit where the bear was waiting for her .
3 He grasped her as she fell and broke her neck , after which he laid her in the snow beside her husband , and went back to tell the bear chief .
4 Hour after hour dragged heavily by in the forest hut , and at last the brother and sister felt quite sure that in some way or other all the rest of the family had perished .
5 Day after day the boy climbed to the top of a tall tree near the house , and sat there till he was almost frozen , looking on all sides through the forest openings , hoping that he might see someone coming along .
6 Very soon all the food in the house was eaten , and he knew he would have to go out and hunt for more .
7 Besides , he wished to seek for his parents .
8 The little girl did not like being left alone in the hut , and cried bitterly ; but her brother told her that there was no use sitting down quietly to starve , and that whether he found any game or not he would certainly be back before the following night .
9 Then he cut himself some arrows , each from a different tree , and winged with the feathers of four different birds .
10 He then made himself a bow , very light and strong , and got down his snow-shoes .
11 All this took some time , and he could not start that day , but early next morning he called his little dog Redmouth , whom he kept in a box , and set out .
12 After he had followed the trail for a great distance he grew very tired , and sat upon the branch of a tree to rest .
13 But Redmouth barked so furiously that the boy thought that perhaps his parents might have been killed under its branches , and stepping back , shot one of his arrows at the root of the tree .

1 Not knowing quite what to make of it all , the boy continued on the trail , and went down the right-hand fork till he came to the clump of bushes where the bears used to hide .
2 Now , as was plain by his being able to change the shape of the two brothers , the bear chief knew a good deal of magic , and he was quite aware that the little boy was following the trail , and he sent a very small but clever bear servant to wait for him in the bushes and to try to tempt him into the mountain .
3 But somehow his spells could not have worked properly that day , as the bear chief did not know that Redmouth had gone with his master , or he would have been more careful .
4 For the moment the dog ran round the bushes barking loudly , the little bear servant rushed out in a fright , and set out for the mountains as fast as he could .
5 The dog followed the bear , and the boy followed the dog , until the mountain , the house of the great bear chief , came in sight .
6 But along the road the snow was so wet and heavy that the boy could hardly get along , and then the thong of his snow-shoes broke , and he had to stop and mend it , so that the bear and the dog got so far ahead that he could scarcely hear the barking .
7 When the strap was firm again the boy spoke to his snow-shoes and said : ` Now you must go as fast as you can , or , if not , I shall lose the dog as well as the bear . '
8 And the snow-shoes sang in answer that they would run like the wind .
9 As he came along , the bear chief 's sister was looking out of the window , and took pity on this little brother , as she had on the two elder ones , and waited to see what the boy would do , when he found that the bear servant and the dog had already entered the mountain .
10 The little brother was certainly very much puzzled at not seeing anything of either of the animals , which had vanished suddenly out of his sight .
11 He paused for an instant to think what he should do next , and while he did so he fancied he heard Redmouth 's voice on the opposite side of the mountain .
12 With great difficulty he scrambled over steep rocks , and forced a path through tangled thickets ; but when he reached the other side the sound appeared to start from the place from which he had come .
13 Then he had to go all the way back again , and at the very top , where he stopped to rest , the barking was directly beneath him , and he knew in an instant where he was and what had happened .
14 ` Let my dog out at once , bear chief ! '
15 cried he .
16 ` If you do not , I shall destroy your palace . '
17 But the bear chief only laughed , and said nothing .
18 The boy was very angry at his silence , and aiming one of his arrows at the bottom of the mountain , shot straight through it .
19 As the arrow touched the ground a rumbling was heard , and with a roar a fire broke out which seemed to split the whole mountain into pieces .
20 The bear chief and all his servants were burnt up in the flames , but his sister and all that belonged to her were spared because she had tried to save the two elder boys from punishment .
21 As soon as the fire had burnt itself out the little hunter entered what was left of the XXXXX , and the first thing he saw was his two brothers -- half bear , half boy .	mountain		animals|anything|arrow|fork|ground|mountain|place|roar|shot|voice

11 An instant later , Thakane arrived , and standing on the bank , she sang : Bring to me Dilah , Dilah the rejected one , Dilah , whom her father Masilo cast out !
12 Then the old woman came out of the water , holding the girl , now tall and slender , by the hand .
13 And as Masilo looked , he saw that she was indeed his daughter , and he wept for joy that she was not lying dead in the bottom of the lake .
14 The old woman , however , seemed uneasy , and said to Thakane : ' I feel as if someone was watching us .
15 I will not leave the girl to-day , but will take her back with me ' ; and sinking beneath the surface , she drew the girl after her .

18 ` My head aches , ' he answered ; ` it aches very badly . '

12 The Wicked Wolverine One day a wolverine was out walking on the hill-side , when , on turning a corner , he suddenly saw a large rock .

14 he asked , for wolverines are cautious animals , and always like to know the reasons of things .
15 ` No , certainly not , ' answered the rock ; ' I do n't know how to walk . '
16 ` But I SAW you walking , ' continued the wolverine . '
17 I am afraid that you were not taught to speak the truth , ' retorted the rock .
18 ` You need not speak like that , for I have SEEN you walking , ' replied the wolverine , ` though I am quite sure that you could never catch ME ! '

5 And he bade messengers hasten to all the neighbouring villages , and tell his people to send him at once all the cattle he possessed .

7 Then Thakane stepped forward in front of the cattle and sang : Bring to me Dilah , Dilah the rejected one , Dilah , whom her father Masilo cast out !

10 The rock stopped at once , but there came a shriek from the wolverine : ` Get off , get off !
11 ca n't you see that you are on my legs ? '
12 ` Why did you not leave me alone ? '
13 asked the rock . '
14 I did not want to move -- I hate moving .
15 But you WOULD have it , and I certainly sha 'n' t move now till I am forced to . ' '
16 I will call my brothers , ' answered the wolverine .
17 ` There are many of them in the forest , and you will soon see that they are stronger than you . '
18 And he called , and called , and called , till wolves and foxes and all sorts of other creatures all came running to see what was the matter .
19 ` How DID you get under that rock ? '
20 asked they , making a ring round him ; but they had to repeat their question several times before the wolverine would answer , for he , like many other persons , found it hard to confess that he had brought his troubles on himself .
21 ` Well , I was dull , and wanted someone to play with me , ' he said at last , in sulky voice , ` and I challenged the XXXXX to catch me .	rock		DID|bottom|chance|forest|matter|mountain|paw|rock|side|sorts

2 And the wolverine laughed and said : ` Oh , that will do just as well ' ; and began to run down the side of the mountain .
3 At first he went quite slowly , ` just to give the rock a chance , ' he thought to himself ; but soon he quickened his pace , for he found that the rock was almost at his heels .
4 But the faster the wolverine ran , the faster the rock rolled , and by-and-by the little creature began to get very tired , and was sorry he had not left the rock to itself .
