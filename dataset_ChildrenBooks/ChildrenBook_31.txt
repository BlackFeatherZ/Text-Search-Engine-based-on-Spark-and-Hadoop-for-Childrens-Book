2 THE RED ETIN There were ance twa widows that lived on a small bit o ' ground , which they rented from a farmer .

6 The young man would have gone away , but he was afraid of the beasts on the outside of the castle ; so he beseeched the old woman to conceal him as well as she could , and not to tell the Etin that he was there .

3 At last his confidants searched his heart and lifted the veil from the face of his love , and then set the matter before his father , King Saman-lal-posh .
4 ` Your son , Prince Tahmasp , loves distractedly the Princess Mihr-afruz , daughter of King Quimus , son of Timus . '
5 Then they told the king all about her and her doings .
6 A mist of sadness clouded the king 's mind , and he said to his son : ` If this thing is so , I will in the first place send a courier with friendly letters to King Quimus , and will ask the hand of his daughter for you .
7 I will send an abundance of gifts , and a string of camels laden with flashing stones and rubies of Badakhsham In this way I will bring her and her suite , and I will give her to you to be your solace .
8 But if King Quimus is unwilling to give her to you , I will pour a whirlwind of soldiers upon him , and I will bring to you , in this way , that most consequential of girls . '
9 But the prince said that this plan would not be right , and that he would go himself , and would answer the riddle .
10 Then the king 's wise men said : ` This is a very weighty matter ; it would be best to allow the prince to set out accompanied by some persons in whom you have confidence .
11 Maybe he will repent and come back . '
12 So King Saman ordered all preparations for the journey to be made , and then Prince Tahmasp took his leave and set out , accompanied by some of the courtiers , and taking with him a string of two-humped and raven-eyed camels laden with jewels , and gold , and costly stuffs .
13 By stage after stage , and after many days ' journeying , he arrived at the city of King Quimus .
14 What did he see ?
15 A towering citadel whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth , and whose battlements touched the blue heaven .
16 He saw hanging from its battlements many heads , but it had not the least effect upon him that these were heads of men of rank ; he listened to no advice about laying aside his fancy , but rode up to the gate and on into the heart of the city .
17 The place was so splendid that the eyes of the ages have never seen its like , and there , in an open square , he found a tent of crimson satin set up , and beneath it two jewelled drums with jewelled sticks .
18 These drums were put there so that the suitors of the princess might announce their arrival by beating on them , after which some one would come and take them to the king 's presence .
19 The sight of the drums stirred the fire of Prince Tahmasp 's love .
20 He dismounted , and moved towards them ; but his companions hurried after and begged him first to let them go and announce him to the king , and said that then , when they had put their possessions in a place of security , they would enter into the all important matter of the princess .
21 The XXXXX , however , replied that he was there for one thing only ; that his first duty was to beat the drums and announce himself as a suitor , when he would be taken , as such , to the king , who would then give him proper lodgment .	prince		arrival|breeze|doings|effect|father|king|preparations|prince|sight|son

11 The place was so splendid that the eyes of the ages have never seen its like , and there , in an open square , he found a tent of crimson satin set up , and beneath it two jewelled drums with jewelled sticks .
12 These drums were put there so that the suitors of the princess might announce their arrival by beating on them , after which some one would come and take them to the king 's presence .
13 The sight of the drums stirred the fire of Prince Tahmasp 's love .

5 Why do you persist in this folly ?

9 I have sworn to myself that I will not marry , even if a thousand years go by , unless someone answers my riddle , and that I will give myself to that man only who does answer it . '
10 The three days passed ; then the riddle was asked : ` What did the rose do to the cypress ? '
11 The prince had an eloquent tongue , which could split a hair , and without hesitation he replied to her with a verse : ` Only the Omnipotent has knowledge of secrets ; if any man says , `` I know '' do not believe him . '

13 took the prince by the arm , placed him upon the cloth of execution , and then , all merciless and stony hearted , cut his head from his body and hung it on the battlements .
14 The news of the death of Prince Tahmasp plunged his father into despair and stupefaction .
15 He mourned for him in black raiment for forty days ; and then , a few days later , his second son , Prince Qamas , extracted from him leave to go too ; and he , also , was put to death .
16 One son only now remained , the brave , eloquent , happy-natured Prince Almas-ruh-bakhsh .
17 One day , when his father sat brooding over his lost children , Almas came before him and said : ' O father mine !
18 the daughter of King Quimus has done my two brothers to death ; I wish to avenge them upon her . '

2 In the forecourt was a royal seat of polished jasper , and in the middle of the platform was a basin of purest water that flashed like a mirror .
3 He pleased himself with these sights for a while , and then went back to the garden and hid himself from the gardeners and passed the night .
4 Next morning he put on the appearance of a madman and wandered about till he came to a lawn where several pert-faced girls were amusing themselves .

13 So another girl went to the water and saw the same thing , and came back with the same story .
14 The princess wished to see for herself ; she rose and paced to the spot with the march of a prancing peacock .

14 Then he let fall the Bismillah from his lips , entered the garden and walked through it till he came to the private part , delighting in the great trees , the lovely verdure , and the flowery borders .
15 In the inner garden there were very many deer .
16 These signed to him with eye and foot to go back , for that this was enchanted ground ; but he did not understand them , and thought their pretty gestures were a welcome .
17 After a while he reached a palace which had a porch more splendid than Caesar 's , and was built of gold and silver bricks .
18 In its midst was a high seat , overlaid with fine carpets , and into it opened eight doors , each having opposite to it a marble basin .
19 Banishing care , Prince Almas walked on through the garden , when suddenly a window opened and a girl , who was lovely enough to make the moon writhe with jealousy , put out her head .
20 She lost her heart to the good looks of the prince , and sent her nurse to fetch him so that she might learn where he came from and how he had got into her private garden where even lions and wolves did not venture .
21 The nurse went , and was struck with amazement at the sun-like radiance of his XXXXX ; she salaamed and said : ' O youth !	face		doors|eyebrow|face|gate|land|lip|purpose|slab|sword|upwards

1 My purpose lies in the land of Qaf and my road is full of peril .
2 Lead me by it . '
3 Then he took a handful of earth and cast it on his collar , and said : ' O earth !
4 be thou my grave ; and O vest !
5 tee thou my winding-sheet ! '
6 Then he took the middle road and went along it , day after day , with many a silent prayer , till he saw trees rise from the weary waste of sand .
7 They grew in a garden , and he went up to the gate and found it a slab of beautifully worked marble , and that near it there lay sleeping , with his head on a stone , a negro whose face was so black that it made darkness round him .
8 His upper lip , arched like an eyebrow , curved upwards to his nostrils and his lower hung down like a camel 's .
9 Four millstones formed his shield , and on a box-tree close by hung his giant sword .
10 His loin-cloth was fashioned of twelve skins of beasts , and was bound round his waist by a chain of which each link was as big as an elephant 's thigh .
