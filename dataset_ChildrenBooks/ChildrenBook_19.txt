1 When the Prince heard it , he was very sorrowful , and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden .
2 Then he said to the wind wizard 's son : `` Beg the raven to fly quickly back to the maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night , for then will I come and fetch her away . ''
3 The wind wizard 's son did this , and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening .
4 The maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home , telling no one what she had heard .
5 As the ninth night drew near she became very unhappy , for she feared lest some terrible mischance should arise and ruin all .
6 On this night she crept quietly out of the house and waited trembling at some little distance from the hut .
7 Presently she heard the muffled tramp of horses , and soon the armed troop appeared , led by the Prince , who had prudently marked all the trees beforehand , in order to know the way .
8 When he saw the maiden he sprang from his horse , lifted her into the saddle , and then , mounting behind , rode homeward .
9 The moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees .
10 By and by the coming of dawn loosened the tongues of all the birds , and , had the Prince only known what they were saying , or the maiden been listening , they might have been spared much sorrow , but they were thinking only of each other , and when they came out of the forest the sun was high in the heavens .
11 Next morning , when the youngest girl did not come to her work , the old woman asked where she was .
12 The sisters pretended not to know , but the old woman easily guessed what had happened , and , as she was in reality a wicked witch , determined to punish the fugitives .
13 Accordingly , she collected nine different kinds of enchanters ' nightshade , added some salt , which she first bewitched , and , doing all up in a cloth into the shape of a fluffy ball , sent it after them on the wings of the wind , saying : `` Whirlwind !
14 -- mother of the wind !
15 Lend thy aid ` gainst her who sinned !
16 Carry with thee this magic ball .
17 Cast her from his arms for ever , Bury her in the rippling river . ''
18 At midday the Prince and his men came to a deep river , spanned by so narrow a bridge that only one rider could cross at a time .
19 The horse on which the Prince and the maiden were riding had just reached the middle when the magic ball flew by .
20 The horse in its fright suddenly reared , and before anyone could stop it flung the maiden into the swift current below .
21 The Prince tried to jump in after her , but his XXXXX held him back , and in spite of his struggles led him home , where for six weeks he shut himself up in a secret chamber , and would neither eat nor drink , so great was his grief .	men		arms|ball|distance|fright|home|house|men|one|salt|time

1 `` Nothing worse than death can befall me , '' thought the Prince , `` and death is better than endless sorrow . ''

4 For one moment the water hissed in his ears , and then all was silent .
5 He swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots , but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time .
6 He then grasped them and rose to the surface , letting the water flow over the flower .
7 The current carried them down the stream , but nowhere could he see the mountain ash .
8 At last he saw it , and close by the large stone .
9 Here he stopped and said : `` From a crab into a man , from a water-lily into a maiden , '' and to his delight found himself once more a prince , and the maiden was by his side .
10 She was ten times more beautiful than before , and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe , sparkling with jewels .
11 She thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witch 's power , and willingly consented to marry him .
12 But when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was nowhere to be seen , for , though the Prince thought he had been a crab only a few hours , he had in reality been under the water for more than ten days .
13 While they were wondering how they should reach his father 's court , they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses coming along the bank .

2 Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince entered , leading the beautiful maiden by the hand .
3 The wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merry-making throughout the kingdom for six weeks .

17 Yet , cowardly as he was , he had not quite the heart to kill the Princess and her baby outright , but he had them put in a huge brass-bound chest and thrust out to sea , that they might either be drowned or starved , or perhaps come to a country where they would be out of his way .
18 So the Princess and the baby floated and drifted in the chest on the sea all day and night , but the baby was not afraid of the waves nor of the wind , for he did not know that they could hurt him , and he slept quite soundly .
19 And the Princess sang a song over him , and this was her song : `` Child , my child , how sound you sleep !
20 Though your mother 's care is deep , You can lie with heart at rest In the narrow brass-bound chest ; In the starless night and drear You can sleep , and never hear Billows breaking , and the cry Of the night-wind wandering by ; In soft purple mantle sleeping With your little face on mine , Hearing not your mother weeping And the breaking of the brine .

16 Well , the daylight came at last , and the great chest was driven by the waves against the shore of an island .
17 There the brass-bound chest lay , with the Princess and her baby in it , till a man of that country came past , and saw it , and dragged it on to the beach , and when he had broken it open , behold !
18 there was a beautiful lady and a little boy .
19 So he took them home , and was very kind to them , and brought up the boy till he was a young man .
20 Now when the boy had come to his full strength the King of that country fell in love with his mother , and wanted to marry her , but he knew that she would never part from her boy .
21 So he thought of a plan to get rid of the XXXXX , and this was his plan : A great Queen of a country not far off was going to be married , and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her .	boy		boy|care|child|grandson|king|prophet|sea|song|way|workmen

1 She did see it , and thought it looked so tempting that she greedily ate it up and at once died .
2 In the secret chamber were found fifty wagon-loads of gold flax , and as much more was discovered buried .
3 The hut was razed to the ground , and the Prince and his bride and her two sisters lived happily ever after .
4 THE TERRIBLE HEAD Once upon a time there was a king whose only child was a girl .
5 Now the King had been very anxious to have a son , or at least a grandson , to come after him , but he was told by a prophet whom he consulted that his own daughter 's son should kill him .
6 This news terrified him so much that he determined never to let his daughter be married , for he thought it was better to have no grandson at all than to be killed by his grandson .
7 He therefore called his workmen together , and bade them dig a deep round hole in the earth , and then he had a prison of brass built in the hole , and then , when it was finished , he locked up his daughter .
8 No man ever saw her , and she never saw even the fields and the sea , but only the sky and the sun , for there was a wide open window in the roof of the house of brass .
9 So the Princess would sit looking up at the sky , and watching the clouds float across , and wondering whether she should ever get out of her prison .
10 Now one day it seemed to her that the sky opened above her , and a great shower of shining gold fell through the window in the roof , and lay glittering in her room .
11 Not very long after , the Princess had a baby , a little boy , but when the King her father heard of it he was very angry and afraid , for now the child was born that should be his death .
12 Yet , cowardly as he was , he had not quite the heart to kill the Princess and her baby outright , but he had them put in a huge brass-bound chest and thrust out to sea , that they might either be drowned or starved , or perhaps come to a country where they would be out of his way .
13 So the Princess and the baby floated and drifted in the chest on the sea all day and night , but the baby was not afraid of the waves nor of the wind , for he did not know that they could hurt him , and he slept quite soundly .
14 And the Princess sang a song over him , and this was her song : `` Child , my child , how sound you sleep !
15 Though your mother 's care is deep , You can lie with heart at rest In the narrow brass-bound chest ; In the starless night and drear You can sleep , and never hear Billows breaking , and the cry Of the night-wind wandering by ; In soft purple mantle sleeping With your little face on mine , Hearing not your mother weeping And the breaking of the brine .

8 There the brass-bound chest lay , with the Princess and her baby in it , till a man of that country came past , and saw it , and dragged it on to the beach , and when he had broken it open , behold !
9 there was a beautiful lady and a little boy .
10 So he took them home , and was very kind to them , and brought up the boy till he was a young man .
11 Now when the boy had come to his full strength the King of that country fell in love with his mother , and wanted to marry her , but he knew that she would never part from her boy .
12 So he thought of a plan to get rid of the boy , and this was his plan : A great Queen of a country not far off was going to be married , and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her .
13 And he made a feast to which he invited them all , and they all brought their presents ; some brought gold cups , and some brought necklaces of gold and amber , and some brought beautiful horses ; but the boy had nothing , though he was the son of a princess , for his mother had nothing to give him .
14 Then the rest of the company began to laugh at him , and the King said : `` If you have nothing else to give , at least you might go and fetch the Terrible Head . ''
15 The boy was proud , and spoke without thinking : `` Then I swear that I will bring the Terrible Head , if it may be brought by a living man .
16 But of what head you speak I know not . ''
17 Then they told him that somewhere , a long way off , there dwelt three dreadful sisters , monstrous ogrish women , with golden wings and claws of brass , and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair .
18 Now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone .
19 And two of them could not be put to death , but the youngest , whose face was very beautiful , could be killed , and it was her head that the boy had promised to bring .
20 You may imagine it was no easy adventure .
21 When he heard all this he was perhaps sorry that he had sworn to bring the Terrible XXXXX , but he was determined to keep his oath .	Head		Child|Head|chest|country|death|feast|lady|man|stone|thinking

1 Not very long after , the Princess had a baby , a little boy , but when the King her father heard of it he was very angry and afraid , for now the child was born that should be his death .
2 Yet , cowardly as he was , he had not quite the heart to kill the Princess and her baby outright , but he had them put in a huge brass-bound chest and thrust out to sea , that they might either be drowned or starved , or perhaps come to a country where they would be out of his way .
3 So the Princess and the baby floated and drifted in the chest on the sea all day and night , but the baby was not afraid of the waves nor of the wind , for he did not know that they could hurt him , and he slept quite soundly .
4 And the Princess sang a song over him , and this was her song : `` Child , my child , how sound you sleep !
5 Though your mother 's care is deep , You can lie with heart at rest In the narrow brass-bound chest ; In the starless night and drear You can sleep , and never hear Billows breaking , and the cry Of the night-wind wandering by ; In soft purple mantle sleeping With your little face on mine , Hearing not your mother weeping And the breaking of the brine .

10 Then the rest of the company began to laugh at him , and the King said : `` If you have nothing else to give , at least you might go and fetch the Terrible Head . ''
11 The boy was proud , and spoke without thinking : `` Then I swear that I will bring the Terrible Head , if it may be brought by a living man .
12 But of what head you speak I know not . ''
13 Then they told him that somewhere , a long way off , there dwelt three dreadful sisters , monstrous ogrish women , with golden wings and claws of brass , and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair .
14 Now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone .
15 And two of them could not be put to death , but the youngest , whose face was very beautiful , could be killed , and it was her head that the boy had promised to bring .
16 You may imagine it was no easy adventure .
17 When he heard all this he was perhaps sorry that he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head , but he was determined to keep his oath .
18 So he went out from the feast , where they all sat drinking and making merry , and he walked alone beside the sea in the dusk of the evening , at the place where the great chest , with himself and his mother in it , had been cast ashore .
19 There he went and sat down on a rock , looking toward the sea , and wondering how he should begin to fulfill his vow .
20 Then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder ; and he turned , and saw a young man like a king 's son , having with him a tall and beautiful lady , whose blue eyes shone like stars .
21 They were taller than mortal men , and the young XXXXX had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it , and two golden serpents twisted round it , and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes .	man		Child|adventure|country|face|head|home|man|son|strength|touch

1 And the Princess sang a song over him , and this was her song : `` Child , my child , how sound you sleep !
2 Though your mother 's care is deep , You can lie with heart at rest In the narrow brass-bound chest ; In the starless night and drear You can sleep , and never hear Billows breaking , and the cry Of the night-wind wandering by ; In soft purple mantle sleeping With your little face on mine , Hearing not your mother weeping And the breaking of the brine .

3 Well , the daylight came at last , and the great chest was driven by the waves against the shore of an island .
4 There the brass-bound chest lay , with the Princess and her baby in it , till a man of that country came past , and saw it , and dragged it on to the beach , and when he had broken it open , behold !
5 there was a beautiful lady and a little boy .
6 So he took them home , and was very kind to them , and brought up the boy till he was a young man .
7 Now when the boy had come to his full strength the King of that country fell in love with his mother , and wanted to marry her , but he knew that she would never part from her boy .

18 Then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder ; and he turned , and saw a young man like a king 's son , having with him a tall and beautiful lady , whose blue eyes shone like stars .
19 They were taller than mortal men , and the young man had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it , and two golden serpents twisted round it , and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes .
20 He spoke to the boy , and asked him why he was so unhappy ; and the boy told him how he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head , and knew not how to begin to set about the adventure .
21 Then the beautiful lady also spoke , and said that `` it was a foolish oath and a hasty , but it might be kept if a brave XXXXX had sworn it . ''	man		feast|man|plan|rest|shore|staff|strength|subjects|thinking|way

1 There the brass-bound chest lay , with the Princess and her baby in it , till a man of that country came past , and saw it , and dragged it on to the beach , and when he had broken it open , behold !
2 there was a beautiful lady and a little boy .
3 So he took them home , and was very kind to them , and brought up the boy till he was a young man .
4 Now when the boy had come to his full strength the King of that country fell in love with his mother , and wanted to marry her , but he knew that she would never part from her boy .
5 So he thought of a plan to get rid of the boy , and this was his plan : A great Queen of a country not far off was going to be married , and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her .
6 And he made a feast to which he invited them all , and they all brought their presents ; some brought gold cups , and some brought necklaces of gold and amber , and some brought beautiful horses ; but the boy had nothing , though he was the son of a princess , for his mother had nothing to give him .
7 Then the rest of the company began to laugh at him , and the King said : `` If you have nothing else to give , at least you might go and fetch the Terrible Head . ''
8 The boy was proud , and spoke without thinking : `` Then I swear that I will bring the Terrible Head , if it may be brought by a living man .
9 But of what head you speak I know not . ''
10 Then they told him that somewhere , a long way off , there dwelt three dreadful sisters , monstrous ogrish women , with golden wings and claws of brass , and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair .
11 Now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone .
12 And two of them could not be put to death , but the youngest , whose face was very beautiful , could be killed , and it was her head that the boy had promised to bring .
13 You may imagine it was no easy adventure .
14 When he heard all this he was perhaps sorry that he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head , but he was determined to keep his oath .

1 So he thought of a plan to get rid of the boy , and this was his plan : A great Queen of a country not far off was going to be married , and this king said that all his subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her .
2 And he made a feast to which he invited them all , and they all brought their presents ; some brought gold cups , and some brought necklaces of gold and amber , and some brought beautiful horses ; but the boy had nothing , though he was the son of a princess , for his mother had nothing to give him .
3 Then the rest of the company began to laugh at him , and the King said : `` If you have nothing else to give , at least you might go and fetch the Terrible Head . ''
4 The boy was proud , and spoke without thinking : `` Then I swear that I will bring the Terrible Head , if it may be brought by a living man .
5 But of what head you speak I know not . ''
6 Then they told him that somewhere , a long way off , there dwelt three dreadful sisters , monstrous ogrish women , with golden wings and claws of brass , and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair .
7 Now these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned at once into stone .
8 And two of them could not be put to death , but the youngest , whose face was very beautiful , could be killed , and it was her head that the boy had promised to bring .
9 You may imagine it was no easy adventure .
10 When he heard all this he was perhaps sorry that he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head , but he was determined to keep his oath .
11 So he went out from the feast , where they all sat drinking and making merry , and he walked alone beside the sea in the dusk of the evening , at the place where the great chest , with himself and his mother in it , had been cast ashore .
12 There he went and sat down on a rock , looking toward the sea , and wondering how he should begin to fulfill his vow .
13 Then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder ; and he turned , and saw a young man like a king 's son , having with him a tall and beautiful lady , whose blue eyes shone like stars .
14 They were taller than mortal men , and the young man had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it , and two golden serpents twisted round it , and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes .
15 He spoke to the boy , and asked him why he was so unhappy ; and the boy told him how he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head , and knew not how to begin to set about the adventure .
16 Then the beautiful lady also spoke , and said that `` it was a foolish oath and a hasty , but it might be kept if a brave man had sworn it . ''
17 Then the boy answered that he was not afraid , if only he knew the way .
18 Then the lady said that to kill the dreadful woman with the golden wings and the brass claws , and to cut off her head , he needed three things : first , a Cap of Darkness , which would make him invisible when he wore it ; next , a Sword of Sharpness , which would cleave iron at one blow ; and last , the Shoes of Swiftness , with which he might fly in the air .
19 The boy answered that he knew not where such things were to be procured , and that , wanting them , he could only try and fail .

5 So he went out from the feast , where they all sat drinking and making merry , and he walked alone beside the sea in the dusk of the evening , at the place where the great chest , with himself and his mother in it , had been cast ashore .
6 There he went and sat down on a rock , looking toward the sea , and wondering how he should begin to fulfill his vow .
7 Then he felt some one touch him on the shoulder ; and he turned , and saw a young man like a king 's son , having with him a tall and beautiful lady , whose blue eyes shone like stars .
8 They were taller than mortal men , and the young man had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it , and two golden serpents twisted round it , and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes .
9 He spoke to the boy , and asked him why he was so unhappy ; and the boy told him how he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head , and knew not how to begin to set about the adventure .
10 Then the beautiful lady also spoke , and said that `` it was a foolish oath and a hasty , but it might be kept if a brave man had sworn it . ''
11 Then the boy answered that he was not afraid , if only he knew the way .
12 Then the lady said that to kill the dreadful woman with the golden wings and the brass claws , and to cut off her head , he needed three things : first , a Cap of Darkness , which would make him invisible when he wore it ; next , a Sword of Sharpness , which would cleave iron at one blow ; and last , the Shoes of Swiftness , with which he might fly in the air .
13 The boy answered that he knew not where such things were to be procured , and that , wanting them , he could only try and fail .
14 Then the young man , taking off his own shoes , said : `` First , you shall use these shoes till you have taken the Terrible Head , and then you must give them back to me .
15 And with these shoes you will fly as fleet as a bird , or a thought , over the land or over the waves of the sea , wherever the shoes know the way .
16 But there are ways which they do not know , roads beyond the borders of the world .
17 And these roads have you to travel .
18 Now first you must go to the Three Gray Sisters , who live far off in the north , and are so very cold that they have only one eye and one tooth among the three .
19 You must creep up close to them , and as one of them passes the eye to the other you must seize it , and refuse to give it up till they have told you the way to the Three Fairies of the Garden , and they will give you the Cap of Darkness and the Sword of Sharpness , and show you how to wing beyond this world to the land of the Terrible Head . ''
20 Then the beautiful lady said : `` Go forth at once , and do not return to say good-by to your mother , for these things must be done quickly , and the Shoes of Swiftness themselves will carry you to the land of the Three Gray Sisters -- for they know the measure of that way . ''
21 So the XXXXX thanked her , and he fastened on the Shoes of Swiftness , and turned to say good-by to the young man and the lady .	boy		borders|boy|cap|face|fleet|land|rock|staff|ways|world

3 Then the young man , taking off his own shoes , said : `` First , you shall use these shoes till you have taken the Terrible Head , and then you must give them back to me .
4 And with these shoes you will fly as fleet as a bird , or a thought , over the land or over the waves of the sea , wherever the shoes know the way .
5 But there are ways which they do not know , roads beyond the borders of the world .
6 And these roads have you to travel .
7 Now first you must go to the Three Gray Sisters , who live far off in the north , and are so very cold that they have only one eye and one tooth among the three .
8 You must creep up close to them , and as one of them passes the eye to the other you must seize it , and refuse to give it up till they have told you the way to the Three Fairies of the Garden , and they will give you the Cap of Darkness and the Sword of Sharpness , and show you how to wing beyond this world to the land of the Terrible Head . ''
9 Then the beautiful lady said : `` Go forth at once , and do not return to say good-by to your mother , for these things must be done quickly , and the Shoes of Swiftness themselves will carry you to the land of the Three Gray Sisters -- for they know the measure of that way . ''
10 So the boy thanked her , and he fastened on the Shoes of Swiftness , and turned to say good-by to the young man and the lady .
11 But , behold !
12 they had vanished , he knew not how or where !
13 Then he leaped in the air to try the Shoes of Swiftness , and they carried him more swiftly than the wind , over the warm blue sea , over the happy lands of the south , over the northern peoples who drank mare 's milk and lived in great wagons , wandering after their flocks .
14 Across the wide rivers , where the wild fowl rose and fled before him , and over the plains and the cold North Sea he went , over the fields of snow and the hills of ice , to a place where the world ends , and all water is frozen , and there are no men , nor beasts , nor any green grass .
15 There in a blue cave of the ice he found the Three Gray Sisters , the oldest of living things .
16 Their hair was as white as the snow , and their flesh of an icy blue , and they mumbled and nodded in a kind of dream , and their frozen breath hung round them like a cloud .
17 Now the opening of the cave in the ice was narrow , and it was not easy to pass in without touching one of the Gray Sisters .
18 But , floating on the Shoes of Swiftness , the boy just managed to steal in , and waited till one of the sisters said to another , who had their one eye : `` Sister , what do you see ?
19 do you see old times coming back ? ''
20 `` No , sister . ''

15 Then they began to implore the boy to give them their eye back again , and he could not help being sorry for them , they were so pitiful .
16 But he said he would never give them the eye till they told him the way to the Fairies of the Garden .
17 Then they wrung their hands miserably , for they guessed why he had come , and how he was going to try to win the Terrible Head .

18 And by the banks of that river , there he found the three Terrible Women all asleep beneath a poplar tree , and the dead poplar leaves lay all about them .
19 Their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed , and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds , and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold .
20 But the youngest slept between her two sisters , and she lay on her back , with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky ; and though she slept her eyes were wide open .
21 If the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it , she was so awful ; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her XXXXX .	face		Fairies|Women|eye|face|hands|river|shoot|singing|sky|wings

1 Then they began to implore the boy to give them their eye back again , and he could not help being sorry for them , they were so pitiful .
2 But he said he would never give them the eye till they told him the way to the Fairies of the Garden .
3 Then they wrung their hands miserably , for they guessed why he had come , and how he was going to try to win the Terrible Head .
4 Now the Dreadful Women were akin to the Three Gray Sisters , and it was hard for them to tell the boy the way .
5 But at last they told him to keep always south , and with the land on his left and the sea on his right , till he reached the Island of the Fairies of the Garden .
6 Then he gave them back the eye , and they began to look out once more for the old times coming back again .
7 But the boy flew south between sea and land , keeping the land always on his left hand , till he saw a beautiful island crowned with flowering trees .
8 There he alighted , and there he found the Three Fairies of the Garden .
9 They were like three very beautiful young women , dressed one in green , one in white , and one in red , and they were dancing and singing round an apple tree with apples of gold , and this was their song : THE SONG OF THE WESTERN FAIRIES Round and round the apples of gold , Round and round dance we ; Thus do we dance from the days of old About the enchanted tree ; Round , and round , and round we go , While the spring is green , or the stream shall flow , Or the wind shall stir the sea !
10 There is none may taste of the golden fruit Till the golden new time come Many a tree shall spring from shoot , Many a blossom be withered at root , Many a song be dumb ; Broken and still shall be many a lute Or ever the new times come !
11 Round and round the tree of gold , Round and round dance we , So doth the great world spin from of old , Summer and winter , and fire and cold , Song that is sung , and tale that is told , Even as we dance , that fold and unfold Round the stem of the fairy tree !
12 These grave dancing fairies were very unlike the Grey Women , and they were glad to see the boy , and treated him kindly .
13 Then they asked him why he had come ; and he told them how he was sent to find the Sword of Sharpness and the Cap of Darkness .
14 And the fairies gave him these , and a wallet , and a shield , and belted the sword , which had a diamond blade , round his waist , and the cap they set on his head , and told him that now even they could not see him though they were fairies .
15 Then he took it off , and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune , and then they began again their eternal dance round the golden tree , for it is their business to guard it till the new times come , or till the world 's ending .
16 So the boy put the cap on his head , and hung the wallet round his waist , and the shining shield on his shoulders , and flew beyond the great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world .

21 As soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining XXXXX from his shoulders , and held it up like a mirror , so that he saw the Dreadful Women reflected in it , and did not see the Terrible Head itself .	shield		Round|cap|eye|hand|land|lute|river|root|shield|singing

1 They were like three very beautiful young women , dressed one in green , one in white , and one in red , and they were dancing and singing round an apple tree with apples of gold , and this was their song : THE SONG OF THE WESTERN FAIRIES Round and round the apples of gold , Round and round dance we ; Thus do we dance from the days of old About the enchanted tree ; Round , and round , and round we go , While the spring is green , or the stream shall flow , Or the wind shall stir the sea !

12 If the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it , she was so awful ; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face .

18 They came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden wings , and their shrieks to each other : '' here , here , '' '' no , there ; this way he went , '' as they chased him .
19 But the Shoes of Swiftness flew too fast for them , and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world .

1 There is none may taste of the golden fruit Till the golden new time come Many a tree shall spring from shoot , Many a blossom be withered at root , Many a song be dumb ; Broken and still shall be many a lute Or ever the new times come !
2 Round and round the tree of gold , Round and round dance we , So doth the great world spin from of old , Summer and winter , and fire and cold , Song that is sung , and tale that is told , Even as we dance , that fold and unfold Round the stem of the fairy tree !
3 These grave dancing fairies were very unlike the Grey Women , and they were glad to see the boy , and treated him kindly .
4 Then they asked him why he had come ; and he told them how he was sent to find the Sword of Sharpness and the Cap of Darkness .
5 And the fairies gave him these , and a wallet , and a shield , and belted the sword , which had a diamond blade , round his waist , and the cap they set on his head , and told him that now even they could not see him though they were fairies .
6 Then he took it off , and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune , and then they began again their eternal dance round the golden tree , for it is their business to guard it till the new times come , or till the world 's ending .
7 So the boy put the cap on his head , and hung the wallet round his waist , and the shining shield on his shoulders , and flew beyond the great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world .
8 And by the banks of that river , there he found the three Terrible Women all asleep beneath a poplar tree , and the dead poplar leaves lay all about them .
9 Their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed , and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds , and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold .
10 But the youngest slept between her two sisters , and she lay on her back , with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky ; and though she slept her eyes were wide open .
11 If the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it , she was so awful ; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face .
12 As soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders , and held it up like a mirror , so that he saw the Dreadful Women reflected in it , and did not see the Terrible Head itself .
13 Then he came nearer and nearer , till he reckoned that he was within a sword 's stroke of the youngest , and he guessed where he should strike a back blow behind him .
14 Then he drew the Sword of Sharpness and struck once , and the Terrible Head was cut from the shoulders of the creature , and the blood leaped out and struck him like a blow .
15 But he thrust the Terrible Head into his wallet , and flew away without looking behind .

19 And he thought her the most beautiful girl in the world .
20 So first with one blow of the Sword of Sharpness he cut the iron chain that bound her , and then he asked her what she did there , and why men treated her so cruelly .
21 And she told him that she was the daughter of the King of that country , and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea ; for the beast came and devoured a XXXXX every day .	girl		back|birds|girl|hair|sea|stake|stone|way|wind|wings

1 Their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed , and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds , and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold .
2 But the youngest slept between her two sisters , and she lay on her back , with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky ; and though she slept her eyes were wide open .
3 If the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it , she was so awful ; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face .
4 As soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders , and held it up like a mirror , so that he saw the Dreadful Women reflected in it , and did not see the Terrible Head itself .
5 Then he came nearer and nearer , till he reckoned that he was within a sword 's stroke of the youngest , and he guessed where he should strike a back blow behind him .
6 Then he drew the Sword of Sharpness and struck once , and the Terrible Head was cut from the shoulders of the creature , and the blood leaped out and struck him like a blow .
7 But he thrust the Terrible Head into his wallet , and flew away without looking behind .
8 Then the two Dreadful Sisters who were left wakened , and rose in the air like great birds ; and though they could not see him because of his Cap of Darkness , they flew after him up the wind , following by the scent through the clouds , like hounds hunting in a wood .
9 They came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden wings , and their shrieks to each other : '' here , here , '' '' no , there ; this way he went , '' as they chased him .
10 But the Shoes of Swiftness flew too fast for them , and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world .
11 Now when the horrible creatures were far in the distance , and the boy found himself on the right side of the river , he flew straight eastward , trying to seek his own country .
12 But as he looked down from the air he saw a very strange sight -- a beautiful girl chained to a stake at the high-water mark of the sea .
13 The girl was so frightened or so tired that she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist , and there she hung , as if she were dead .
14 The boy was very sorry for her and flew down and stood beside her .
15 When he spoke she raised her head and looked round , but his voice only seemed to frighten her .
16 Then he remembered that he was wearing the Cap of Darkness , and that she could only hear him , not see him .
17 So he took it off , and there he stood before her , the handsomest young man she had ever seen in all her life , with short curly yellow hair , and blue eyes , and a laughing face .

1 They came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden wings , and their shrieks to each other : '' here , here , '' '' no , there ; this way he went , '' as they chased him .
2 But the Shoes of Swiftness flew too fast for them , and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world .
3 Now when the horrible creatures were far in the distance , and the boy found himself on the right side of the river , he flew straight eastward , trying to seek his own country .
4 But as he looked down from the air he saw a very strange sight -- a beautiful girl chained to a stake at the high-water mark of the sea .
5 The girl was so frightened or so tired that she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist , and there she hung , as if she were dead .
6 The boy was very sorry for her and flew down and stood beside her .
7 When he spoke she raised her head and looked round , but his voice only seemed to frighten her .
8 Then he remembered that he was wearing the Cap of Darkness , and that she could only hear him , not see him .
9 So he took it off , and there he stood before her , the handsomest young man she had ever seen in all her life , with short curly yellow hair , and blue eyes , and a laughing face .
10 And he thought her the most beautiful girl in the world .
11 So first with one blow of the Sword of Sharpness he cut the iron chain that bound her , and then he asked her what she did there , and why men treated her so cruelly .
12 And she told him that she was the daughter of the King of that country , and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea ; for the beast came and devoured a girl every day .
13 Now the lot had fallen on her ; and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl .
14 But the beast had been too greedy and too hurried , so he missed his aim the first time .
15 Before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the Terrible Head out of his wallet and held it up .
16 And when the sea beast leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head , and instantly it was turned into a stone .
17 And the stone beast is there on the sea-coast to this day .
18 Then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the King , her father , where everyone was weeping for her death , and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well .

20 she ran into her son 's very arms , but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her , when the King struck at him with his sword .
21 The XXXXX caught the blow on his shield , and cried to the King : `` I swore to bring you the Terrible Head , and see how I keep my oath ! ''	boy		Head|aim|beast|boy|bride|everyone|eyes|mother|street|town

1 And he thought her the most beautiful girl in the world .
2 So first with one blow of the Sword of Sharpness he cut the iron chain that bound her , and then he asked her what she did there , and why men treated her so cruelly .
3 And she told him that she was the daughter of the King of that country , and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea ; for the beast came and devoured a girl every day .
4 Now the lot had fallen on her ; and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl .
5 But the beast had been too greedy and too hurried , so he missed his aim the first time .
6 Before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the Terrible Head out of his wallet and held it up .
7 And when the sea beast leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head , and instantly it was turned into a stone .
8 And the stone beast is there on the sea-coast to this day .
9 Then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the King , her father , where everyone was weeping for her death , and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well .
10 And the King and Queen made much of the boy , and could not contain themselves for delight when they found he wanted to marry their daughter .
11 So the two were married with the most splendid rejoicings , and when they had passed some time at court they went home in a ship to the boy 's own country .
12 For he could not carry his bride through the air , so he took the Shoes of Swiftness , and the Cap of Darkness , and the Sword of Sharpness up to a lonely place in the hills .
13 There he left them , and there they were found by the man and woman who had met him at home beside the sea , and had helped him to start on his journey .
14 When this had been done the boy and his bride set forth for home , and landed at the harbor of his native land .
15 But whom should he meet in the very street of the town but his own mother , flying for her life from the wicked King , who now wished to kill her because he found that she would never marry him !
16 For if she had liked the King ill before , she liked him far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly .
17 She did not know , of course , where the boy had gone , but thought the King had slain him secretly .
18 So now she was running for her very life , and the wicked King was following her with a sword in his hand .
19 Then , behold !
20 she ran into her son 's very arms , but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her , when the King struck at him with his sword .
