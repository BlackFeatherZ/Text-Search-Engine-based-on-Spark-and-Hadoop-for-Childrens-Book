12 `` The honor of saving your life is to be mine , '' interrupted Patypata , and , before they could prevent her , she had picked up a knife and cut her head off in an instant .
13 But when the Captain of the Guard would have taken her tongue it turned out to be quite black , so that would not have deceived the King either .
14 `` Am I not unlucky ? ''
15 cried the poor Princess ; `` I lose everything I love , and am none the better for it . ''
16 `` If you had accepted my offer , '' said Tintin , `` you would only have had me to regret , and I should have had all your gratitude . ''
17 Miranda kissed her little dog , crying so bitterly , that at last she could bear it no longer , and turned away into the forest .
18 When she looked back the Captain of the Guard was gone , and she was alone , except for Patypata , Grabugeon , and Tintin , who lay upon the ground .
19 She could not leave the place until she had buried them in a pretty little mossy grave at the foot of a tree , and she wrote their names upon the bark of the tree , and how they had all died to save her life .
20 And then she began to think where she could go for safety -- for this forest was so close to her father 's castle that she might be seen and recognized by the first passer-by , and , besides that , it was full of lions and wolves , who would have snapped up a princess just as soon as a stray chicken .
21 So she began to walk as fast as she could , but the forest was so large and the sun was so hot that she nearly died of heat and terror and fatigue ; look which way she would there seemed to be no end to the XXXXX , and she was so frightened that she fancied every minute that she heard the King running after her to kill her .	forest		Land|affection|dispute|dog|forest|head|honor|none|place|words

1 `` You are right , Princess , '' said Grabugeon , coming forward , `` to love such a faithful slave as Patypata ; she is of more use to you than I am , I offer you my tongue and my heart most willingly , especially as I wish to make a great name for myself in Goblin Land . ''
2 `` No , no , my little Grabugeon , '' replied Miranda , `` I can not bear the thought of taking your life . ''
3 `` Such a good little dog as I am , '' cried Tintin , `` could not think of letting either of you die for his mistress .
4 If anyone is to die for her it must be me . ''
5 And then began a great dispute between Patypata , Grabugeon , and Tintin , and they came to high words , until at last Grabugeon , who was quicker than the others , ran up to the very top of the nearest tree , and let herself fall , head first , to the ground , and there she lay -- quite dead !
6 The Princess was very sorry , but as Grabugeon was really dead , she allowed the Captain of the Guard to take her tongue ; but , alas !
7 it was such a little one -- not bigger than the Princess 's thumb -- that they decided sorrowfully that it was of no use at all : the King would not have been taken in by it for a moment !

1 You may imagine how miserable she was , and how she cried as she went on , not knowing which path to follow , and with the thorny bushes scratching her dreadfully and tearing her pretty frock to pieces .
2 At last she heard the bleating of a sheep , and said to herself : `` No doubt there are shepherds here with their flocks ; they will show me the way to some village where I can live disguised as a peasant girl .
3 Alas !
4 it is not always kings and princes who are the happiest people in the world .
5 Who could have believed that I should ever be obliged to run away and hide because the King , for no reason at all , wishes to kill me ? ''
6 So saying she advanced toward the place where she heard the bleating , but what was her surprise when , in a lovely little glade quite surrounded by trees , she saw a large sheep ; its wool was as white as snow , and its horns shone like gold ; it had a garland of flowers round its neck , and strings of great pearls about its legs , and a collar of diamonds ; it lay upon a bank of orange-flowers , under a canopy of cloth of gold which protected it from the heat of the sun .
7 Nearly a hundred other sheep were scattered about , not eating the grass , but some drinking coffee , lemonade , or sherbet , others eating ices , strawberries and cream , or sweetmeats , while others , again , were playing games .
8 Many of them wore golden collars with jewels , flowers , and ribbons .
9 Miranda stopped short in amazement at this unexpected sight , and was looking in all directions for the shepherd of this surprising flock , when the beautiful sheep came bounding toward her .
10 `` Approach , lovely Princess , '' he cried ; `` have no fear of such gentle and peaceable animals as we are . ''
11 `` What a marvel ! ''
12 cried the Princess , starting back a little .
13 `` Here is a sheep that can talk . ''
14 `` Your monkey and your dog could talk , madam , '' said he ; `` are you more astonished at us than at them ? ''
15 `` A fairy gave them the power to speak , '' replied Miranda .
16 `` So I was used to them . ''

1 `` Your monkey and your dog could talk , madam , '' said he ; `` are you more astonished at us than at them ? ''
2 `` A fairy gave them the power to speak , '' replied Miranda .
3 `` So I was used to them . ''
4 `` Perhaps the same thing has happened to us , '' he said , smiling sheepishly .
5 `` But , Princess , what can have led you here ? ''
6 `` A thousand misfortunes , Sir Sheep , '' she answered .
7 `` I am the unhappiest princess in the world , and I am seeking a shelter against my father 's anger . ''
8 `` Come with me , madam , '' said the Sheep ; `` I offer you a hiding-place which you only will know of , and where you will be mistress of everything you see . ''
9 `` I really can not follow you , '' said Miranda , `` for I am too tired to walk another step . ''
10 The Sheep with the golden horns ordered that his chariot should be fetched , and a moment after appeared six goats , harnessed to a pumpkin , which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it , and was all lined with cushions of velvet and down .
11 The Princess stepped into it , much amused at such a new kind of carriage , the King of the Sheep took his place beside her , and the goats ran away with them at full speed , and only stopped when they reached a cavern , the entrance to which was blocked by a great stone .
12 This the King touched with his foot , and immediately it fell down , and he invited the Princess to enter without fear .
13 Now , if she had not been so alarmed by everything that had happened , nothing could have induced her to go into this frightful cave , but she was so afraid of what might be behind her that she would have thrown herself even down a well at this moment .
14 So , without hesitation , she followed the Sheep , who went before her , down , down , down , until she thought they must come out at the other side of the world -- indeed , she was not sure that he was n't leading her into Fairyland .
15 At last she saw before her a great plain , quite covered with all sorts of flowers , the scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled before ; a broad river of orange-flower water flowed round it and fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the prettiest little cascades and brooks .

16 When Miranda heard it she begged the King of the Sheep to allow her to go and see the wedding as before .
17 This request made him feel very sad , as if some misfortune must surely come of it , but his love for the Princess being stronger than anything else he did not like to refuse her .
18 `` You wish to leave me , Princess , '' said he ; `` it is my unhappy fate -- you are not to blame .
19 I consent to your going , but , believe me , I can give you no stronger proof of my love than by so doing . ''
20 The Princess assured him that she would only stay a very short time , as she had done before , and begged him not to be uneasy , as she would be quite as much grieved if anything detained her as he could possibly be .

1 The King caused an escort suitable to her rank to be got ready for her , and she dressed herself splendidly , not forgetting anything that could make her more beautiful .
2 Her chariot was of mother-of-pearl , drawn by six dun-colored griffins just brought from the other side of the world , and she was attended by a number of guards in splendid uniforms , who were all at least eight feet high and had come from far and near to ride in the Princess 's train .
3 Miranda reached her father 's palace just as the wedding ceremony began , and everyone , as soon as she came in , was struck with surprise at her beauty and the splendor of her jewels .
4 She heard exclamations of admiration on all sides ; and the King her father looked at her so attentively that she was afraid he must recognize her ; but he was so sure that she was dead that the idea never occurred to him .
5 However , the fear of not getting away made her leave before the marriage was over .

7 On it was written in diamond letters : `` Jewels for the Bride , '' and when they opened it , which they did as soon as it was found , there seemed to be no end to the pretty things it contained .
8 The King , who had hoped to join the unknown Princess and find out who she was , was dreadfully disappointed when she disappeared so suddenly , and gave orders that if she ever came again the doors were to be shut that she might not get away so easily .

1 When he reached the palace he asked for Miranda , but by this time everyone had heard the story of her adventures , and did not want her to go back again to the King of the Sheep , so they refused sternly to let him see her .
2 In vain he begged and prayed them to let him in ; though his entreaties might have melted hearts of stone they did not move the guards of the palace , and at last , quite broken-hearted , he fell dead at their feet .
3 In the meantime the King , who had not the least idea of the sad thing that was happening outside the gate of his palace , proposed to Miranda that she should be driven in her chariot all round the town , which was to be illuminated with thousands and thousands of torches , placed in windows and balconies , and in all the grand squares .
4 But what a sight met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace !
5 There lay her dear , kind sheep , silent and motionless , upon the pavement !
6 She threw herself out of the chariot and ran to him , crying bitterly , for she realized that her broken promise had cost him his life , and for a long , long time she was so unhappy that they thought she would have died too .

9 LITTLE THUMB There was , once upon a time , a man and his wife fagot-makers by trade , who had several children , all boys .
10 The eldest was but ten years old , and the youngest only seven .
11 They were very poor , and their seven children incommoded them greatly , because not one of them was able to earn his bread .
12 That which gave them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was of a very puny constitution , and scarce ever spoke a word , which made them take that for stupidity which was a sign of good sense .
13 He was very little , and when born no bigger than one 's thumb , which made him be called Little Thumb .
14 The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house , and , guilty or not , was always in the wrong ; he was , notwithstanding , more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together ; and , if he spake little , he heard and thought the more .
15 There happened now to come a very bad year , and the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children .
16 One evening , when they were all in bed and the fagot-maker was sitting with his wife at the fire , he said to her , with his heart ready to burst with grief : `` Thou seest plainly that we are not able to keep our children , and I can not see them starve to death before my face ; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to-morrow , which may very easily be done ; for , while they are busy in tying up fagots , we may run away , and leave them , without their taking any notice .

1 The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house , and , guilty or not , was always in the wrong ; he was , notwithstanding , more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together ; and , if he spake little , he heard and thought the more .
2 There happened now to come a very bad year , and the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children .
3 One evening , when they were all in bed and the fagot-maker was sitting with his wife at the fire , he said to her , with his heart ready to burst with grief : `` Thou seest plainly that we are not able to keep our children , and I can not see them starve to death before my face ; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to-morrow , which may very easily be done ; for , while they are busy in tying up fagots , we may run away , and leave them , without their taking any notice .

6 In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty : she would not consent to it ; she was indeed poor , but she was their mother .
7 However , having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger , she at last consented , and went to bed all in tears .
8 Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken ; for observing , as he lay in his bed , that they were talking very busily , he got up softly , and hid himself under his father 's stool , that he might hear what they said without being seen .
9 He went to bed again , but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night , thinking on what he had to do .
10 He got up early in the morning , and went to the river-side , where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles , and then returned home .
11 They all went abroad , but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew .
12 They went into a very thick forest , where they could not see one another at ten paces distance .
13 The fagot-maker began to cut wood , and the children to gather up the sticks to make fagots .
14 Their father and mother , seeing them busy at their work , got away from them insensibly , and ran away from them all at once , along a by-way through the winding bushes .
15 When the children saw they were left alone , they began to cry as loud as they could .

7 They could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by Little Thumb , who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former ; but , though he got up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles , he was disappointed , for he found the house-door double-locked , and was at a stand what to do .

10 `` But you have so much meat already , '' replied his wife , `` you have no occasion ; here are a calf , two sheep , and half a hog . ''
11 `` That is true , '' said the Ogre ; `` give them their belly full that they may not fall away , and put them to bed . ''
12 The good woman was overjoyed at this , and gave them a good supper ; but they were so much afraid they could not eat a bit .
13 As for the Ogre , he sat down again to drink , being highly pleased that he had got wherewithal to treat his friends .
14 He drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary , which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed .
15 The Ogre had seven daughters , all little children , and these young ogresses had all of them very fine complexions , because they used to eat fresh meat like their father ; but they had little gray eyes , quite round , hooked noses , and very long sharp teeth , standing at a good distance from each other .
16 They were not as yet over and above mischievous , but they promised very fair for it , for they had already bitten little children , that they might suck their blood .
17 They had been put to bed early , with every one a crown of gold upon her head .
18 There was in the same chamber a bed of the like bigness , and it was into this bed the Ogre 's wife put the seven little boys , after which she went to bed to her husband .
19 Little Thumb , who had observed that the Ogre 's daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads , and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent his not killing them , got up about midnight , and , taking his brothers ' bonnets and his own , went very softly and put them upon the heads of the seven little ogresses , after having taken off their crowns of gold , which he put upon his own head and his brothers ' , that the Ogre might take them for his daughters , and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill .
20 All this succeeded according to his desire ; for , the Ogre waking about midnight , and sorry that he deferred to do that till morning which he might have done over-night , threw himself hastily out of bed , and , taking his great knife , `` Let us see , '' said he , `` how our little rogues do , and not make two jobs of the matter . ''
21 He then went up , groping all the way , into his XXXXX ' chamber , and , coming to the bed where the little boys lay , and who were every soul of them fast asleep , except Little Thumb , who was terribly afraid when he found the Ogre fumbling about his head , as he had done about his brothers ' , the Ogre , feeling the golden crowns , said : `` I should have made a fine piece of work of it , truly ; I find I drank too much last night .

1 `` Ah , ah ! ''
2 said he ; `` I see then how thou wouldst cheat me , thou cursed woman ; I know not why I do not eat thee up too , but it is well for thee that thou art a tough old carrion .
3 Here is good game , which comes very quickly to entertain three ogres of my acquaintance who are to pay me a visit in a day or two . ''
4 With that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one .
5 The poor children fell upon their knees , and begged his pardon ; but they had to do with one of the most cruel ogres in the world , who , far from having any pity on them , had already devoured them with his eyes , and told his wife they would be delicate eating when tossed up with good savory sauce .
6 He then took a great knife , and , coming up to these poor children , whetted it upon a great whet-stone which he held in his left hand .
7 He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him : `` Why need you do it now ?
8 Is it not time enough to-morrow ? ''
9 `` Hold your prating , '' said the Ogre ; `` they will eat the tenderer .
10 `` But you have so much meat already , '' replied his wife , `` you have no occasion ; here are a calf , two sheep , and half a hog . ''
