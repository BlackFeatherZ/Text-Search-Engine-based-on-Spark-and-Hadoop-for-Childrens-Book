19 The kettle soon began to sing and bubble , and Ball Carrier was lifted in .
20 Very soon the fat which was to make the sauce rose to the surface , and Ball-Carrier , who was bobbing about from one side to the other , called out that Lung-Woman had better taste the broth , as he though that some salt should be added to it .
21 The servant knew quite well that her master had forbidden her to do any thing of the kind , but when once the idea was put into her head , she found the smell from the XXXXX so delicious that she unhooked a long ladle from the wall and plunged it into the kettle .	kettle		bubble|friends|kettle|kitchen|name|orders|sauce|skin|spirits|woman

7 ` He will do now , ' said the Bad One , who came constantly to see how he was getting on . '
8 I shall go and tell the water-demons that we expect them to dinner to-night .
9 Put the kettle on the fire , but be sure on no account to taste the broth . '
10 Lung-Woman lost no time in obeying her orders .
11 She built up the fire , which had got very low , filled the kettle with water , and passing a rope which hung from the ceiling through the handle , swung it over the flames .
12 Then she brought in Ball-Carrier , who , seeing all these preparations , wished that as long as he was in the kettle the water might not really boil , though it would hiss and bubble , and also , that the spirits would turn the water into fat .
13 The kettle soon began to sing and bubble , and Ball Carrier was lifted in .
14 Very soon the fat which was to make the sauce rose to the surface , and Ball-Carrier , who was bobbing about from one side to the other , called out that Lung-Woman had better taste the broth , as he though that some salt should be added to it .
15 The servant knew quite well that her master had forbidden her to do any thing of the kind , but when once the idea was put into her head , she found the smell from the kettle so delicious that she unhooked a long ladle from the wall and plunged it into the kettle .
16 ` You will spill it all , if you stand so far off , ' said the boy ; ` why do n't you come a little nearer ? '
17 And as she did so he cried to the spirits to give him back his usual size and strength and to make the water scalding hot Then he gave the kettle a kick , which upset all the boiling water upon her , and jumping over her body he seized once more the gold and the bridge , picked up his club and bow and arrows , and after setting fire to the Bad One 's hut , ran down to the river , which he crossed safely by the help of the bridge .
18 The hut , which was made of wood , was burned to the ground before the Bad One came back with a large crowd of water-demons .
19 There was not a sign of anyone or anything , so he started for the river , where he saw Ball Carrier sitting quietly on the other side .
20 Then the Bad One knew what had happened , and after telling the water demons that there would be no feast after all , he called to Ball-Carrier , who was eating an apple . '
21 I know your XXXXX now , ' he said , ` and as you have ruined me , and I am not rich any more , will you take me as your servant ? '	name		account|club|dinner|friends|help|laugh|name|servant|size|wall

2 As it is , your friends the water-demons would think you meant to laugh at them , when they found that I was the feast . '

17 During this time he wandered into many strange places , and had many adventures ; and one day he came to a hut where a young girl lived .
18 He was tired and hungry and begged her to let him in and rest , and he stayed a long while , and the girl became his wife .
19 One morning he saw two children playing in front of the hut , and went out to speak to them .
20 But as soon as they saw him they set up cries of horror and ran away .
21 ` They are the children of my sister who has been on a long journey , ' replied his XXXXX , ` and now that she knows you are my husband she wants to kill you . '	wife		arrows|bridge|grandmother|midst|name|rest|sauce|thing|water|wife

1 The servant knew quite well that her master had forbidden her to do any thing of the kind , but when once the idea was put into her head , she found the smell from the kettle so delicious that she unhooked a long ladle from the wall and plunged it into the kettle .
2 ` You will spill it all , if you stand so far off , ' said the boy ; ` why do n't you come a little nearer ? '
3 And as she did so he cried to the spirits to give him back his usual size and strength and to make the water scalding hot Then he gave the kettle a kick , which upset all the boiling water upon her , and jumping over her body he seized once more the gold and the bridge , picked up his club and bow and arrows , and after setting fire to the Bad One 's hut , ran down to the river , which he crossed safely by the help of the bridge .
4 The hut , which was made of wood , was burned to the ground before the Bad One came back with a large crowd of water-demons .
5 There was not a sign of anyone or anything , so he started for the river , where he saw Ball Carrier sitting quietly on the other side .
6 Then the Bad One knew what had happened , and after telling the water demons that there would be no feast after all , he called to Ball-Carrier , who was eating an apple . '
7 I know your name now , ' he said , ` and as you have ruined me , and I am not rich any more , will you take me as your servant ? '
8 ` Yes , I will , though you have tried to kill me , ' answered Ball-Carrier , throwing the bridge across the water as he spoke .
9 But when the Bad One was in the midst of the stream , the boy wished it to become small ; and the Bad One fell into the water and was drowned , and the world was rid of him .

1 Then gradually he heard her creeping up behind him , and soon she was in front .
2 So Ball-Carrier took the shape of a pigeon and flew rapidly past her , but in a little while she was in front again and the end of the prairie was in sight . '

9 What bird was there whose flight was swifter than his ?
10 Would not the good spirits tell him ?
11 Ah , of course he knew ; why had he not thought of it at first and spared himself all that fatigue ?
12 And the next instant a humming bird , dressed in green and blue , flashed past the woman and entered the house .
13 The witch came panting up , furious at having lost the race which she felt certain of winning ; and Ball-Carrier , who had by this time changed back into his own shape , struck her on the head and killed her .
14 For a long while Ball-Carrier was content to stay quietly at home with his wife and children , for he was tired of adventures , and only did enough hunting to supply the house with food .

2 And the next instant a humming bird , dressed in green and blue , flashed past the woman and entered the house .
3 The witch came panting up , furious at having lost the race which she felt certain of winning ; and Ball-Carrier , who had by this time changed back into his own shape , struck her on the head and killed her .
4 For a long while Ball-Carrier was content to stay quietly at home with his wife and children , for he was tired of adventures , and only did enough hunting to supply the house with food .
5 But one day he happened to eat some poisonous berries that he had found in the forest , and grew so ill that he felt he was going to die .

11 The mother said she must have a little time to think over it , as her daughter was still very young ; so it was settled that the man should go away for a month with his friends , and then come back to see if the girl was willing .
12 Now ever since Ball-Carrier 's death the family had been very poor , and often could not get enough to eat .
13 One morning the girl , who had had no supper and no breakfast , wandered off to look for cranberries , and though she was quite near home was astonished at noticing a large hut , which certainly had not been there when last she had come that way .

1 So his wife and her three children watched by him as long as he was alive , and after he was dead they took him up and laid the body on a platform of stakes which they had prepared in the grove .
2 And as they returned weeping to the hut they caught a glimpse of the ball rolling away down the path back to the old grandmother .
3 One of the sons sprang forward to stop it , for Ball-Carrier had often told them the tale of how it had helped him to cross the river , but it was too quick for him , and they had to content themselves with the war club and bow and arrows , which were put carefully away .
4 By-and-by some travellers came past , and the chief among them asked leave to marry Ball-Carrier 's daughter .
5 The mother said she must have a little time to think over it , as her daughter was still very young ; so it was settled that the man should go away for a month with his friends , and then come back to see if the girl was willing .
6 Now ever since Ball-Carrier 's death the family had been very poor , and often could not get enough to eat .
7 One morning the girl , who had had no supper and no breakfast , wandered off to look for cranberries , and though she was quite near home was astonished at noticing a large hut , which certainly had not been there when last she had come that way .
8 No one was about , so she ventured to peep in , and her surprise was increased at seeing , heaped up in one corner , a quantity of food of all sorts , while a little robin redbreast stood perched on a beam looking down upon her .
9 ` It is my father , I am sure , ' she cried ; and the bird piped in answer .
10 From that day , whenever they wanted food they went to the hut , and though the robin could not speak , he would hop on their shoulders and let them feed him with the food they knew he liked best .
11 When the man came back he found the girl looking so much prettier and fatter than when he had left her , that he insisted that they should be married on the spot .
12 And the mother , who did not know how to get rid of him , gave in .
13 The husband spent all his time in hunting , and the family had never had so much meat before ; but the man , who had seen for himself how poor they were , noticed with amazement that they did not seem to care about it , or to be hungry .
14 ` They must get food from somewhere , ' he thought , and one morning , when he pretended to be going out to hunt , he hid in a thicket to watch .
15 Very soon they all left the house together , and walked to the other hut , which the girl 's husband saw for the first time , as it was hid in a hollow .
16 He followed , and noticed that each one went up to the redbreast , and shook him by the claw ; and he then entered boldly and shook the bird 's claw too .

8 ` Here , in my left arm-pit , ' answered he .

10 After she had finished she asked again : ` My grandson , did you manage to get that bridge from the Bad One ? '
11 ` Yes , grandmother , I got that too , ' answered he .

13 she asked , and Ball-Carrier lifted his right arm , and pointed to his arm-pit .
14 ` Here is the bridge , grandmother , ' said he .
15 Then the witch did something that nobody in the world could have guessed that she would do .
16 First , she took the gold and said to Ball-carrier : ` My grandson , this gold must be hidden in the earth , for if people think they can get it when they choose , they will become lazy and stupid .
17 But if we take it and bury it in different parts of the world they will have to work for it if they want it , and then will only find a little at a time . '
18 And as she spoke , she pulled up one of the poles of the hut , and Ball-Carrier saw that underneath was a deep , deep hole , which seemed to have no bottom .
19 Down this hole she poured all the gold , and when it was out of sight it ran about all over the world , where people that dig hard sometimes find it .
20 And after that was done she put the pole back again .
21 Next she lifted down a spade from a high shelf , where it had grown quite rusty , and dug a very small hole on the opposite side of the XXXXX -- very small , but very deep .	hut		Bad|bottom|grandmother|hole|hut|pole|sight|skin|witch|woman

18 The sun was hot , but they liked heat , and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest , or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang , which always returns to the thrower .
19 They did not get on very fast at this rate , but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water , but was now , in the height of summer , only a set of pools , each surrounded with a fringe of plants , with bulrushes standing in the inside of all .
20 In that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes , which they think as good as onions , and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp .
21 It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket , and they were just going to wade into the XXXXX and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out : ` After all , why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children ?	water		anyone|boomerang|gold|onions|parts|pole|rate|side|sun|water

4 And as she spoke , she pulled up one of the poles of the hut , and Ball-Carrier saw that underneath was a deep , deep hole , which seemed to have no bottom .
5 Down this hole she poured all the gold , and when it was out of sight it ran about all over the world , where people that dig hard sometimes find it .

12 For a long time they cast patiently , without receiving a single bite ; the sun had grown low in the sky , and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed , not even with a basket of roots to show ; when the youth , who had baited his hook with raw meat , suddenly saw his line disappear under the water .
13 Something , a very heavy fish he supposed , was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet , and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool .
14 He cried to his friends to help him , and at last , trembling with fright at what they were going to see , they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal , but something of both , with a long , broad tail .
15 They looked at each other with horror , cold shivers running down their spines ; for though they had never beheld it , there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was -- the cub of the awful Bunyip !
16 All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail , answered by another from the other side of the pool , as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them , rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes .
17 ` Let it go !

19 whispered the young men to each other ; but the captor declared that he had caught it , and was going to keep it .
20 ` He had promised his sweetheart , ' he said , ` that he would bring back enough meat for her father 's house to feast on for three days , and though they could not eat the little Bunyip , her brothers and sisters should have it to play with . '

5 The sun was hot , but they liked heat , and as they went they ran races and tried who could hurl his spear the farthest , or was cleverest in throwing a strange weapon called a boomerang , which always returns to the thrower .
6 They did not get on very fast at this rate , but presently they reached a flat place that in time of flood was full of water , but was now , in the height of summer , only a set of pools , each surrounded with a fringe of plants , with bulrushes standing in the inside of all .
7 In that country the people are fond of the roots of bulrushes , which they think as good as onions , and one of the young men said that they had better collect some of the roots and carry them back to the camp .
8 It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket , and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out : ` After all , why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children ?

3 It did not take them long to weave the tops of the willows into a basket , and they were just going to wade into the water and pull up the bulrush roots when a youth suddenly called out : ` After all , why should we waste our time in doing work that is only fit for women and children ?
4 Let them come and get the roots for themselves ; but we will fish for eels and anything else we can get . '
5 This delighted the rest of the party , and they all began to arrange their fishing lines , made from the bark of the yellow mimosa , and to search for bait for their hooks .
6 Most of them used worms , but one , who had put a piece of raw meat for dinner into his skin wallet , cut off a little bit and baited his line with it , unseen by his companions .
7 For a long time they cast patiently , without receiving a single bite ; the sun had grown low in the sky , and it seemed as if they would have to go home empty-handed , not even with a basket of roots to show ; when the youth , who had baited his hook with raw meat , suddenly saw his line disappear under the water .
8 Something , a very heavy fish he supposed , was pulling so hard that he could hardly keep his feet , and for a few minutes it seemed either as if he must let go or be dragged into the pool .
9 He cried to his friends to help him , and at last , trembling with fright at what they were going to see , they managed between them to land on the bank a creature that was neither a calf nor a seal , but something of both , with a long , broad tail .
10 They looked at each other with horror , cold shivers running down their spines ; for though they had never beheld it , there was not a man amongst them who did not know what it was -- the cub of the awful Bunyip !
11 All of a sudden the silence was broken by a low wail , answered by another from the other side of the pool , as the mother rose up from her den and came towards them , rage flashing from her horrible yellow eyes .
12 ` Let it go !
13 let it go ! '
14 whispered the young men to each other ; but the captor declared that he had caught it , and was going to keep it .
15 ` He had promised his sweetheart , ' he said , ` that he would bring back enough meat for her father 's house to feast on for three days , and though they could not eat the little Bunyip , her brothers and sisters should have it to play with . '
16 So , flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back , he threw the little Bunyip on to his shoulders , and set out for the camp , never heeding the poor mother 's cries of distress .
17 By this time it was getting near sunset , and the plain was in shadow , though the tops of the mountains were still quite bright .
18 The youths had all ceased to be afraid , when they were startled by a low rushing sound behind them , and , looking round , saw that the pool was slowly rising , and the spot where they had landed the Bunyip was quite covered .
19 ` What could it be ? '
20 they asked one of another ; ` there was not a cloud in the sky , yet the water had risen higher already than they had ever known it do before . '
21 For an instant they stood watching as if they were frozen , then they turned and ran with all their might , the XXXXX with the Bunyip running faster than all .	man		basket|calf|camp|cloud|den|man|seal|sky|something|spot

2 Yet , somehow , he could never tell why , he looked up and saw the tavern in front of him , which he thought was miles , and miles , and miles away .
3 ` Bring the best wine you have got , and two glasses , good mother , ' he said as he entered , ` and if you are fond of fish there is enough here to feed the house .

9 ` Be quick , be quick , and pick them up , ' cried the man .

9 Again and again they tried , but the basket was only a basket , with a few scales of fish sticking to the bottom , for the innkeeper 's wife had taken it to market the day before .
10 ` What is the matter with the thing ? '
11 cried the father at last , snatching the basket from them , and turning it all over , grumbling and swearing while he did so , under the eyes of his astonished wife and children , who did not know whether to cry or to laugh .
12 ` It certainly smells of fish , ' he said , and then he stopped , for a sudden thought had come to him .
13 ` Suppose it is not mine at all ; supposing -- Ah , the scoundrels ! '
14 And without listening to his wife and children , who were frightened at his strange conduct and begged him to stay at home , he ran across to the tavern and burst open the door .
15 ` Can I do anything for you , Father Grumbler ? '
16 asked the innkeeper 's wife in her softest voice . '
17 I have taken the wrong basket -- by mistake , of course , ' said he .
18 ` Here is yours , will you give me back my own ? '
19 ` Why , what are you talking about ? '
20 answered she .

14 And though Father Grumbler DID look , it was quite true that none was to be seen .
15 ` Come , take a glass to warm you this cold day , ' said the woman , who was anxious to keep him in a good temper , and as this was an invitation Father Grumbler never refused , he tossed it off and left the house .
16 He took the road that led to the Holy Man 's cave , and made such haste that it was not long before he reached it .
17 ` Who is there ? '
18 said a voice in answer to his knock .
19 ` It is me , it is me , Holy man .
