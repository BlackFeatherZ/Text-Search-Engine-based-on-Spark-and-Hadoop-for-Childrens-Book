14 As he was running off he cried over his shoulder : ` As long as the world lasts the asps ' eyes will go down in the heads of foxes from generation to generation . '
15 And so it has been ; and if you look at the eyes of an asp you will see that they are all burnt ; and though thousands and thousands of years have gone by since the fox was going about playing tricks upon everybody he met , the asp still bears the traces of the day when the sly creature cooked the salmon .

2 So he took the eyes out of his own head and popped them into the head of the asp , and put the asp 's eyes in their place .
3 As he was running off he cried over his shoulder : ` As long as the world lasts the asps ' eyes will go down in the heads of foxes from generation to generation . '
4 And so it has been ; and if you look at the eyes of an asp you will see that they are all burnt ; and though thousands and thousands of years have gone by since the fox was going about playing tricks upon everybody he met , the asp still bears the traces of the day when the sly creature cooked the salmon .

6 Kisa the Cat Once upon a time there lived a queen who had a beautiful cat , the colour of smoke , with china-blue eyes , which she was very fond of .
7 The cat was constantly with her , and ran after her wherever she went , and even sat up proudly by her side when she drove out in her fine glass coach .
8 ` Oh , pussy , ' said the queen one day , ` you are happier than I am !
9 For you have a dear kitten just like yourself , and I have nobody to play with but you . '
10 ` Do n't cry , ' answered the cat , laying her paw on her mistress 's arm .
11 ` Crying never does any good .
12 I will see what can be done . '
13 The cat was as good as her word .
14 As soon as she returned from her drive she trotted off to the forest to consult a fairy who dwelt there , and very soon after the queen had a little girl , who seemed made out of snow and sunbeams .
15 The queen was delighted , and soon the baby began to take notice of the kitten as she jumped about the room , and would not go to sleep at all unless the kitten lay curled up beside her .
16 Two or three months went by , and though the baby was still a baby , the kitten was fast becoming a cat , and one evening when , as usual , the nurse came to look for her , to put her in the baby 's cot , she was nowhere to be found .
17 What a hunt there was for that kitten , to be sure !
18 The servants , each anxious to find her , as the queen was certain to reward the lucky man , searched in the most impossible places .
19 Boxes were opened that would hardly have held the kitten 's paw ; books were taken from bookshelves , lest the kitten should have got behind them , drawers were pulled out , for perhaps the kitten might have got shut in .

16 The Lion and the Cat Far away on the other side of the world there lived , long ago , a lion and his younger brother , the wild cat , who were so fond of each other that they shared the same hut .
17 The lion was much the bigger and stronger of the two -- indeed , he was much bigger and stronger than any of the beasts that dwelt in the forest ; and , besides , he could jump father and run faster than all the rest .
18 If strength and swiftness could gain him a dinner he was sure never to be without one , but when it came to cunning , both the grizzly bear and the serpent could get the better of him , and he was forced to call in the help of the wild cat .
19 Now the young wild cat had a lovely golden ball , so beautiful that you could hardly look at it except through a piece of smoked glass , and he kept it hidden in the thick fur muff that went round his neck .
20 A very large old animal , since dead , had given it to him when he was hardly more than a baby , and had told him never to part with it , for as long as he kept it no harm could ever come near him .
21 In general the wild cat did not need to use his XXXXX , for the lion was fond of hunting , and could kill all the food that they needed ; but now and then his life would have been in danger had it not been for the golden ball .	ball		ALL|baby|ball|bear|fairy|glass|gold|night|prince|reward

4 The king and the queen were greatly pleased , as the young man was the son of a neighbouring king , and they gave orders that a splendid feast should be got ready .

1 If strength and swiftness could gain him a dinner he was sure never to be without one , but when it came to cunning , both the grizzly bear and the serpent could get the better of him , and he was forced to call in the help of the wild cat .
2 Now the young wild cat had a lovely golden ball , so beautiful that you could hardly look at it except through a piece of smoked glass , and he kept it hidden in the thick fur muff that went round his neck .
3 A very large old animal , since dead , had given it to him when he was hardly more than a baby , and had told him never to part with it , for as long as he kept it no harm could ever come near him .
4 In general the wild cat did not need to use his ball , for the lion was fond of hunting , and could kill all the food that they needed ; but now and then his life would have been in danger had it not been for the golden ball .
5 One day the two brothers started to hunt at daybreak , but as the cat could not run nearly as fast as the lion , he had quite a long start .
6 At least he THOUGHT it was a long one , but in a very few bounds and springs the lion reached his side .
7 ` There is a bear sitting on that tree , ' he whispered softly .
8 ` He is only waiting for us to pass , to drop down on my back . '
9 ` Ah , you are so big that he does not see I am behind you , ' answered the wild cat .
10 And , touching the ball , he just said : ` Bear , die ! '
11 And the bear tumbled dead out of the tree , and rolled over just in front of them .
12 For some time they trotted on without any adventures , till just as they were about to cross a strip of long grass on the edge of the forest , the lion 's quick ears detected a faint rustling noise .
13 ` That is a snake , ' he cried , stopping short , for he was much more afraid of snakes than of bears .
14 ` Oh , it is all right , ' answered the cat .
15 ` Snake , die ! '
16 And the snake died , and the two brothers skinned it .
17 They then folded the skin up into a very small parcel , and the cat tucked it into his mane , for snakes ' skins can do all sorts of wonderful things , if you are lucky enough to have one of them .
18 All this time they had had no dinner , for the snake 's flesh was not nice , and the lion did not like eating bear -- perhaps because he never felt sure that the bear was REALLY dead , and would not jump up alive when his enemy went near him .

3 And the snake died , and the two brothers skinned it .

2 asked the boy-brother , springing up .
3 ` Well , no , ' replied the man-brother .
4 ` The fact is , that I did not get up to them till we had run half way across the world and left the wind far behind us .
5 Think what a trouble it would have been to drag it here !
6 So -- I just ate them both . '
7 The cat said nothing , but he did not feel that he loved his big brother .
8 He had thought a great deal about that deer , and had meant to get on his back to ride him as a horse , and go to see all the wonderful places the lion talked to him about when he was in a good temper .
9 The more he thought of it the more sulky he grew , and in the morning , when the lion said that it was time for them to start to hunt , the cat told him that he might kill the bear and snake by himself , as HE had a headache , and would rather stay at home .
10 The little fellow knew quite well that the lion would not dare to go out without him and his ball for fear of meeting a bear or a snake .
11 The quarrel went on , and for many days neither of the brothers spoke to each other , and what made them still more cross was , that they could get very little to eat , and we know that people are often cross when they are hungry .
12 At last it occurred to the lion that if he could only steal the magic ball he could kill bears and snakes for himself , and then the cat might be as sulky as he liked for anything that it would matter .
13 But how was the stealing to be done ?
14 The cat had the ball hung round his neck day and night , and he was such a light sleeper that it was useless to think of taking it while he slept .
15 No !
16 the only thing was to get him to lend it of his own accord , and after some days the lion -LRB- who was not at all clever -RRB- hit upon a plan that he thought would do .
17 ` Dear me , how dull it is here ! '
18 said the lion one afternoon , when the rain was pouring down in such torrents that , however sharp your eyes or your nose might be , you could not spy a single bird or beast among the bushes .

10 the only thing was to get him to lend it of his own accord , and after some days the lion -LRB- who was not at all clever -RRB- hit upon a plan that he thought would do .
11 ` Dear me , how dull it is here ! '
12 said the lion one afternoon , when the rain was pouring down in such torrents that , however sharp your eyes or your nose might be , you could not spy a single bird or beast among the bushes .
13 ` Dear me , how dull , how dreadfully dull I am .
14 Could n't we have a game of catch with that golden ball of yours ? ' '
15 I do n't care about playing catch , it does not amuse me , ' answered the cat , who was as cross as ever ; for no cat , even to this day , ever forgets an injury done to him .
16 ` Well , then , lend me the ball for a little , and I will play by myself , ' replied the lion , stretching out a paw as he spoke .
17 ` You ca n't play in the rain , and if you did , you would only lose it in the bushes , ' said the cat .
18 ` Oh , no , I wo n't ; I will play in here .
19 Do n't be so ill-natured . '
20 And with a very bad grace the cat untied the string and threw the golden ball into the lion 's lap , and composed himself to sleep again .
21 For a long while the lion tossed it up and down gaily , feeling that , however sound asleep the boy-brother might LOOK , he was sure to have one eye open ; but gradually he began to edge closer to the opening , and at last gave such a toss that the XXXXX went up high into the air , and he could not see what became of it .	ball		ball|bird|catch|cross|day|grace|nose|rain|snake|time

1 The more he thought of it the more sulky he grew , and in the morning , when the lion said that it was time for them to start to hunt , the cat told him that he might kill the bear and snake by himself , as HE had a headache , and would rather stay at home .
2 The little fellow knew quite well that the lion would not dare to go out without him and his ball for fear of meeting a bear or a snake .
3 The quarrel went on , and for many days neither of the brothers spoke to each other , and what made them still more cross was , that they could get very little to eat , and we know that people are often cross when they are hungry .
4 At last it occurred to the lion that if he could only steal the magic ball he could kill bears and snakes for himself , and then the cat might be as sulky as he liked for anything that it would matter .
5 But how was the stealing to be done ?
6 The cat had the ball hung round his neck day and night , and he was such a light sleeper that it was useless to think of taking it while he slept .

1 ` Well , then , lend me the ball for a little , and I will play by myself , ' replied the lion , stretching out a paw as he spoke .

12 But months passed , and years passed , and though he travelled over hundreds of miles , he never saw any traces of it .
13 At length , when he was getting quite old , he came to a place unlike any that he had ever seen before , where a big river rolled right to the foot of some high mountains .
14 The ground all about the river bank was damp and marshy , and as no cat likes to wet its feet , this one climbed a tree that rose high above the water , and thought sadly of his lost ball , which would have helped him out of this horrible place .
15 Suddenly he saw a beautiful ball , for all the world like his own , dangling from a branch of the tree he was on .
16 He longed to get at it ; but was the branch strong enough to bear his weight ?

1 Suddenly he saw a beautiful ball , for all the world like his own , dangling from a branch of the tree he was on .
2 He longed to get at it ; but was the branch strong enough to bear his weight ?
3 It was no use , after all he had done , getting drowned in the water .
4 However , it could do no harm , if he was to go a little way ; he could always manage to get back somehow .
5 So he stretched himself at full length upon the branch , and wriggled his body cautiously along .
6 To his delight it seemed thick and stout .
7 Another movement , and , by stretching out his paw , he would be able to draw the string towards him , when the branch gave a loud crack , and the cat made haste to wriggle himself back the way he had come .
8 But when cats make up their minds to do anything they generally DO it ; and this cat began to look about to see if there was really no way of getting at his ball .
9 Yes !
10 there was , and it was much surer than the other , though rather more difficult .
11 Above the bough where the ball was hung was another bough much thicker , which he knew could not break with his weight ; and by holding on tight to this with all his four paws , he could just manage to touch the ball with his tail .
12 He would thus be able to whisk the ball to and fro till , by-and-by , the string would become quite loose , and it would fall to the ground .

7 Which was the Foolishest ?
8 In a little village that stood on a wide plain , where you could see the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set , there lived two couples side by side .
9 The men , who worked under the same master , were quite good friends , but the wives were always quarrelling , and the subject they quarrelled most about was -- which of the two had the stupidest husband .
10 Unlike most women -- who think that anything that belongs to them must be better than what belongs to anyone else -- each thought her husband the more foolish of the two .
11 ` You should just see what he does ! '
12 one said to her neighbour .
13 ` He puts on the baby 's frock upside down , and , one day , I found him trying to feed her with boiling soup , and her mouth was scalded for days after .
14 Then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes , and one day he wanted to go into the garden from the top window , because he declared it was a shorter way than through the door . '
15 ` That is bad enough , of course , ' answered the other ; ` but it is really NOTHING to what I have to endure every day from MY husband .
16 If , when I am busy , I ask him to go and feed the poultry , he is certain to give them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food , and when I visit the yard next I find them all dead .
17 Once he even took my best bonnet , when I had gone away to my sick mother , and when I came back I found he had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in .

1 If , when I am busy , I ask him to go and feed the poultry , he is certain to give them some poisonous stuff instead of their proper food , and when I visit the yard next I find them all dead .
2 Once he even took my best bonnet , when I had gone away to my sick mother , and when I came back I found he had given it to the hen to lay her eggs in .
3 And you know yourself that , only last week , when I sent him to buy a cask of butter , he returned driving a hundred and fifty ducks which someone had induced him to take , and not one of them would lay . '

7 ` YOU may think that there is nothing on it , ' answered she , ` but I can assure you that there is a large skein of wool , so fine that nobody can see it , which will be woven into a coat for you . '
