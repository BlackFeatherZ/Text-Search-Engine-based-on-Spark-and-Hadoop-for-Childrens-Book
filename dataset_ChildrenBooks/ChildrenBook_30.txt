1 But you must do one thing more for me , which will be every whit as agreeable to me .

15 Prince Ahmed set out the next morning at the time appointed by the Fairy , and followed her directions exactly .

1 In the second place , you must have two horses ; one you must ride yourself , and the other you must lead , which must be loaded with a sheep cut into four quarters , that must be killed to-day .
2 In the third place , you must be provided with a bottle , which I will give you , to bring the water in .
3 Set out early to-morrow morning , and when you have passed the iron gate throw the clew of thread before you , which will roll till it comes to the gates of the castle .
4 Follow it , and when it stops , as the gates will be open , you will see the four lions : the two that are awake will , by their roaring , wake the other two , but do n't be frightened , but throw each of them a quarter of mutton , and then clap spurs to your horse and ride to the fountain ; fill your bottle without alighting , and then return with the same expedition .
5 The lions will be so busy eating they will let you pass by them . ''
6 Prince Ahmed set out the next morning at the time appointed by the Fairy , and followed her directions exactly .
7 When he arrived at the gates of the castle he distributed the quarters of mutton among the four lions , and , passing through the midst of them bravely , got to the fountain , filled his bottle , and returned back as safe and sound as he went .
8 When he had gone a little distance from the castle gates he turned him about , and , perceiving two of the lions coming after him , he drew his sabre and prepared himself for defense .
9 But as he went forward he saw one of them turned out of the road at some distance , and showed by his head and tail that he did not come to do him any harm , but only to go before him , and that the other stayed behind to follow , he put his sword up again in its scabbard .
10 Guarded in this manner , he arrived at the capital of the Indies , but the lions never left him till they had conducted him to the gates of the Sultan 's palace ; after which they returned the same way they came , though not without frightening all that saw them , for all they went in a very gentle manner and showed no fierceness .
11 A great many officers came to attend the Prince while he dismounted his horse , and afterward conducted him into the Sultan 's apartment , who was at that time surrounded with his favorites .
12 He approached toward the throne , laid the bottle at the Sultan 's feet , and kissed the rich tapestry which covered his footstool , and then said : `` I have brought you , sir , the healthful water which your Majesty desired so much to keep among your other rarities in your treasury , but at the same time wish you such extraordinary health as never to have occasion to make use of it . ''
13 After the Prince had made an end of his compliment the Sultan placed him on his right hand , and then said to him : `` Son , I am very much obliged to you for this valuable present , as also for the great danger you have exposed yourself to upon my account -LRB- which I have been informed of by a magician who knows the Fountain of Lions -RRB- ; but do me the pleasure , '' continued he , `` to inform me by what address , or , rather , by what incredible power , you have been secured . ''
14 `` Sir , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` I have no share in the compliment your Majesty is pleased to make me ; all the honor is due to the Fairy my spouse , whose good advice I followed . ''
15 Then he informed the Sultan what those directions were , and by the relation of this his expedition let him know how well he had behaved himself .
16 When he had done the Sultan , who showed outwardly all the demonstrations of great joy , but secretly became more jealous , retired into an inward apartment , where he sent for the magician .
17 The magician , at her arrival , saved the Sultan the trouble to tell her of the success of Prince Ahmed 's journey , which she had heard of before she came , and therefore was prepared with an infallible means , as she pretended .
18 This means she communicated to the Sultan who declared it the next day to the Prince , in the midst of all his courtiers , in these words : `` Son , '' said he , `` I have one thing more to ask of you , after which I shall expect nothing more from your obedience , nor your interest with your wife .

21 The next XXXXX the Prince returned to his dear Paribanou , to whom he told his father 's new demand , which , he said , he looked upon to be a thing more impossible than the two first ; `` for , '' added he , `` I can not imagine there can be such a man in the world ; without doubt , he has a mind to try whether or no I am so silly as to go about it , or he has a design on my ruin .	day		danger|day|distance|half|obedience|sir|spouse|sword|thing|world

13 The magician , at her arrival , saved the Sultan the trouble to tell her of the success of Prince Ahmed 's journey , which she had heard of before she came , and therefore was prepared with an infallible means , as she pretended .
14 This means she communicated to the Sultan who declared it the next day to the Prince , in the midst of all his courtiers , in these words : `` Son , '' said he , `` I have one thing more to ask of you , after which I shall expect nothing more from your obedience , nor your interest with your wife .
15 This request is , to bring me a man not above a foot and a half high , and whose beard is thirty feet long who carries a bar of iron upon his shoulders of five hundredweight , which he uses as a quarterstaff . ''
16 Prince Ahmed , who did not believe that there was such a man in the world as his father described , would gladly have excused himself ; but the Sultan persisted in his demand , and told him the Fairy could do more incredible things .
17 The next day the Prince returned to his dear Paribanou , to whom he told his father 's new demand , which , he said , he looked upon to be a thing more impossible than the two first ; `` for , '' added he , `` I can not imagine there can be such a man in the world ; without doubt , he has a mind to try whether or no I am so silly as to go about it , or he has a design on my ruin .
18 In short , how can he suppose that I should lay hold of a man so well armed , though he is but little ?
19 What arms can I make use of to reduce him to my will ?
20 If there are any means , I beg you will tell them , and let me come off with honor this time . ''
21 `` Do n't affright yourself , Prince , '' replied the Fairy ; `` you ran a risk in fetching the Water of the Fountain of Lions for your father , but there 's no danger in finding out this XXXXX , who is my brother Schaibar , but is so far from being like me , though we both had the same father , that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks of his resentment for a slight offense ; yet , on the other hand , is so good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire .	man		directions|father|fierceness|head|hold|honor|man|manner|tail|thing

2 A great many officers came to attend the Prince while he dismounted his horse , and afterward conducted him into the Sultan 's apartment , who was at that time surrounded with his favorites .
3 He approached toward the throne , laid the bottle at the Sultan 's feet , and kissed the rich tapestry which covered his footstool , and then said : `` I have brought you , sir , the healthful water which your Majesty desired so much to keep among your other rarities in your treasury , but at the same time wish you such extraordinary health as never to have occasion to make use of it .

8 The magician , at her arrival , saved the Sultan the trouble to tell her of the success of Prince Ahmed 's journey , which she had heard of before she came , and therefore was prepared with an infallible means , as she pretended .
9 This means she communicated to the Sultan who declared it the next day to the Prince , in the midst of all his courtiers , in these words : `` Son , '' said he , `` I have one thing more to ask of you , after which I shall expect nothing more from your obedience , nor your interest with your wife .

11 Prince Ahmed , who did not believe that there was such a man in the world as his father described , would gladly have excused himself ; but the Sultan persisted in his demand , and told him the Fairy could do more incredible things .

16 `` Do n't affright yourself , Prince , '' replied the Fairy ; `` you ran a risk in fetching the Water of the Fountain of Lions for your father , but there 's no danger in finding out this man , who is my brother Schaibar , but is so far from being like me , though we both had the same father , that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks of his resentment for a slight offense ; yet , on the other hand , is so good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire .

7 The next day the Prince returned to his dear Paribanou , to whom he told his father 's new demand , which , he said , he looked upon to be a thing more impossible than the two first ; `` for , '' added he , `` I can not imagine there can be such a man in the world ; without doubt , he has a mind to try whether or no I am so silly as to go about it , or he has a design on my ruin .

10 If there are any means , I beg you will tell them , and let me come off with honor this time . ''
11 `` Do n't affright yourself , Prince , '' replied the Fairy ; `` you ran a risk in fetching the Water of the Fountain of Lions for your father , but there 's no danger in finding out this man , who is my brother Schaibar , but is so far from being like me , though we both had the same father , that he is of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks of his resentment for a slight offense ; yet , on the other hand , is so good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire .
12 He is made exactly as the Sultan your father has described him , and has no other arms than a bar of iron of five hundred pounds weight , without which he never stirs , and which makes him respected .

14 `` What !
15 my Queen , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` do you say Schaibar is your brother ?
16 Let him be never so ugly or deformed I shall be so far from being frightened at the sight of him that , as our brother , I shall honor and love him . ''
17 The Fairy ordered a gold chafing-dish to be set with a fire in it under the porch of her palace , with a box of the same metal , which was a present to her , out of which taking a perfume , and throwing it into the fire , there arose a thick cloud of smoke .
18 Some moments after the Fairy said to Prince Ahmed : `` See , there comes my brother . ''
19 The Prince immediately perceived Schaibar coming gravely with his heavy bar on his shoulder , his long beard , which he held up before him , and a pair of thick mustachios , which he tucked behind his ears and almost covered his face ; his eyes were very small and deep-set in his head , which was far from being of the smallest size , and on his head he wore a grenadier 's cap ; besides all this , he was very much hump-backed .
20 If Prince Ahmed had not known that Schaibar was Paribanou 's brother , he would not have been able to have looked at him without fear , but , knowing first who he was , he stood by the Fairy without the least concern .
21 Schaibar , as he came forward , looked at the Prince earnestly enough to have chilled his blood in his veins , and asked Paribanou , when he first accosted her , who that XXXXX was .	man		beard|concern|day|demand|demonstrations|father|man|midst|size|success

2 The magician , at her arrival , saved the Sultan the trouble to tell her of the success of Prince Ahmed 's journey , which she had heard of before she came , and therefore was prepared with an infallible means , as she pretended .
3 This means she communicated to the Sultan who declared it the next day to the Prince , in the midst of all his courtiers , in these words : `` Son , '' said he , `` I have one thing more to ask of you , after which I shall expect nothing more from your obedience , nor your interest with your wife .

13 At these words , Schaibar , looking on Prince Ahmed favorably , said : `` Is there anything else , sister , wherein I can serve him ?
14 It is enough for me that he is your husband to engage me to do for him whatever he desires . ''

19 When they arrived at the gates of the capital the people no sooner saw Schaibar but they ran and hid themselves ; and some shut up their shops and locked themselves up in their houses , while others , flying , communicated their fear to all they met , who stayed not to look behind them , but ran too ; insomuch that Schaibar and Prince Ahmed , as they went along , found the streets all desolate till they came to the palaces where the porters , instead of keeping the gates , ran away too , so that the Prince and Schaibar advanced without any obstacle to the council-hall , where the Sultan was seated on his throne , and giving audience .
20 Here likewise the ushers , at the approach of Schaibar , abandoned their posts , and gave them free admittance .
21 Schaibar went boldly and fiercely up to the throne , without waiting to be presented by Prince Ahmed , and accosted the Sultan of the XXXXX in these words : `` Thou hast asked for me , '' said he ; `` see , here I am ; what wouldst thou have with me ?

2 `` What !

4 Let him be never so ugly or deformed I shall be so far from being frightened at the sight of him that , as our brother , I shall honor and love him . ''
5 The Fairy ordered a gold chafing-dish to be set with a fire in it under the porch of her palace , with a box of the same metal , which was a present to her , out of which taking a perfume , and throwing it into the fire , there arose a thick cloud of smoke .
6 Some moments after the Fairy said to Prince Ahmed : `` See , there comes my brother . ''
7 The Prince immediately perceived Schaibar coming gravely with his heavy bar on his shoulder , his long beard , which he held up before him , and a pair of thick mustachios , which he tucked behind his ears and almost covered his face ; his eyes were very small and deep-set in his head , which was far from being of the smallest size , and on his head he wore a grenadier 's cap ; besides all this , he was very much hump-backed .
8 If Prince Ahmed had not known that Schaibar was Paribanou 's brother , he would not have been able to have looked at him without fear , but , knowing first who he was , he stood by the Fairy without the least concern .
9 Schaibar , as he came forward , looked at the Prince earnestly enough to have chilled his blood in his veins , and asked Paribanou , when he first accosted her , who that man was .

18 He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain , and used to wade over to the mainland in search of prey ; when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back , and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist , and march back to his own abode .
19 The giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy him .
20 Jack took a horn , a shovel , a pickaxe , his armor , and a dark lantern , and one winter 's evening he went to the mount .
21 There he dug a pit twenty-two XXXXX deep and twenty broad .	feet		advice|feet|flight|hand|offer|rest|sight|stroke|throne|words

1 The Sultan , instead of answering him , clapped his hands before his eyes to avoid the sight of so terrible an object ; at which uncivil and rude reception Schaibar was so much provoked , after he had given him the trouble to come so far , that he instantly lifted up his iron bar and killed him before Prince Ahmed could intercede in his behalf .
2 All that he could do was to prevent his killing the grand vizier , who sat not far from him , representing to him that he had always given the Sultan his father good advice .
3 `` These are they , then , '' said Schaibar , `` who gave him bad , '' and as he pronounced these words he killed all the other viziers and flattering favorites of the Sultan who were Prince Ahmed 's enemies .
4 Every time he struck he killed some one or other , and none escaped but they who were not so frightened as to stand staring and gaping , and who saved themselves by flight .
5 When this terrible execution was over Schaibar came out of the council-hall into the midst of the courtyard with the iron bar upon his shoulder , and , looking hard at the grand vizier , who owed his life to Prince Ahmed , he said : `` I know here is a certain magician , who is a greater enemy of my brother-in-law than all these base favorites I have chastised .
6 Let the magician be brought to me presently . ''
7 The grand vizier immediately sent for her , and as soon as she was brought Schaibar said , at the time he fetched a stroke at her with his iron bar : `` Take the reward of thy pernicious counsel , and learn to feign sickness again . ''
8 After this he said : `` This is not yet enough ; I will use the whole town after the same manner if they do not immediately acknowledge Prince Ahmed , my brother-in-law , for their Sultan and the Sultan of the Indies . ''
9 Then all that were there present made the air echo again with the repeated acclamations of : `` Long life to Sultan Ahmed '' ; and immediately after he was proclaimed through the whole town .
10 Schaibar made him be clothed in the royal vestments , installed him on the throne , and after he had caused all to swear homage and fidelity to him went and fetched his sister Paribanou , whom he brought with all the pomp and grandeur imaginable , and made her to be owned Sultaness of the Indies .
11 As for Prince Ali and Princess Nouronnihar , as they had no hand in the conspiracy against Prince Ahmed and knew nothing of any , Prince Ahmed assigned them a considerable province , with its capital , where they spent the rest of their lives .
12 Afterwards he sent an officer to Prince Houssain to acquaint him with the change and make him an offer of which province he liked best ; but that Prince thought himself so happy in his solitude that he bade the officer return the Sultan his brother thanks for the kindness he designed him , assuring him of his submission ; and that the only favor he desired of him was to give him leave to live retired in the place he had made choice of for his retreat .

6 THE HISTORY OF JACK THE GIANT-KILLER In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad named Jack , who was a boy of a bold temper , and took delight in hearing or reading of conjurers , giants , and fairies ; and used to listen eagerly to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur 's Round Table .
7 In those days there lived on St. Michael 's Mount , off Cornwall , a huge giant , eighteen feet high and nine feet round ; his fierce and savage looks were the terror of all who beheld him .
8 He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain , and used to wade over to the mainland in search of prey ; when he would throw half a dozen oxen upon his back , and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his waist , and march back to his own abode .
9 The giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy him .
10 Jack took a horn , a shovel , a pickaxe , his armor , and a dark lantern , and one winter 's evening he went to the mount .
11 There he dug a pit twenty-two feet deep and twenty broad .
12 He covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground .
13 He then blew his horn so loudly that the giant awoke and came out of his den crying out : `` You saucy villain !
14 you shall pay for this I 'll broil you for my breakfast ! ''
15 He had just finished , when , taking one step further , he tumbled headlong into the pit , and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him .
16 Jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news .
17 Another giant , called Blunderbore , vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever he should have him in his power .
18 This giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood ; and some time after the death of Cormoran Jack was passing through a wood , and being weary , sat down and went to sleep .
19 The giant , passing by and seeing Jack , carried him to his castle , where he locked him up in a large room , the floor of which was covered with the bodies , skulls and bones of men and women .
20 Soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant , to take a meal off his flesh ; and Jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching .
21 Jack , perceiving in one corner of the XXXXX a strong cord , took courage , and making a slip-knot at each end , he threw them over their heads , and tied it to the window-bars ; he then pulled till he had choked them .	room		air|bars|horn|mountain|nothing|pickaxe|pomp|province|room|solitude

10 The giant , passing by and seeing Jack , carried him to his castle , where he locked him up in a large room , the floor of which was covered with the bodies , skulls and bones of men and women .
11 Soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant , to take a meal off his flesh ; and Jack saw with terror through the bars of his prison the two giants approaching .
12 Jack , perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord , took courage , and making a slip-knot at each end , he threw them over their heads , and tied it to the window-bars ; he then pulled till he had choked them .
13 When they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to the heart .
14 Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore , and went into the castle again .
15 He made a strict search through all the rooms , and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads , and almost starved to death .
16 They told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants , who had then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands .
17 `` Ladies , '' said Jack , `` I have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother ; and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains , to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt . ''
18 He then very politely gave them the keys of the castle , and went further on his journey to Wales .

4 Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore , and went into the castle again .
5 He made a strict search through all the rooms , and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads , and almost starved to death .
6 They told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants , who had then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands .
7 `` Ladies , '' said Jack , `` I have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother ; and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains , to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt . ''
8 He then very politely gave them the keys of the castle , and went further on his journey to Wales .
9 As Jack had but little money , he went on as fast as possible .
10 At length he came to a handsome house .
11 Jack knocked at the door , when there came forth a Welsh giant .
12 Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way , on which the giant made him welcome , and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in .
13 Jack took off his clothes quickly , but though he was weary he could not go to sleep .
14 Soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room , and saying to himself : `` Though here you lodge with me this night , You shall not see the morning light ; My club shall dash your brains out quite . ''
15 `` Say you so ? ''
16 thought Jack .
17 `` Are these your tricks upon travelers ?
18 But I hope to prove as cunning as you are . ''
19 Then , getting out of bed , he groped about the room , and at last found a large thick billet of wood .
20 He laid it in his own place in the bed , and then hid himself in a dark corner of the room .
21 The giant , about midnight , entered the apartment , and with his bludgeon struck many blows on the bed , in the very place where Jack had laid the log ; and then he went back to his own XXXXX , thinking he had broken all Jack 's bones .	room		Ladies|castle|door|end|heads|house|place|room|rope|way

16 Jack , having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings , resolved not to be idle in future ; he therefore furnished himself with a horse , a cap of knowledge , a sword of sharpness , shoes of swiftness , and an invisible coat , the better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay before him .
17 He traveled over high hills , and on the third day he came to a large and spacious forest through which his road lay .
18 Scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady .
19 Jack alighted from his horse , and tying him to an oak tree , put on his invisible coat , under which he carried his sword of sharpness .
20 When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him , but could not reach his body , but wounded his thighs in several places ; and at length , putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might , he cut off both his legs .
21 Then Jack , setting his foot upon his neck , plunged his XXXXX into the giant 's body , when the monster gave a groan and expired .	sword		blows|coat|floor|forest|heads|hold|matter|slaps|sword|touch

14 Scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady .
15 Jack alighted from his horse , and tying him to an oak tree , put on his invisible coat , under which he carried his sword of sharpness .
16 When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him , but could not reach his body , but wounded his thighs in several places ; and at length , putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might , he cut off both his legs .
17 Then Jack , setting his foot upon his neck , plunged his sword into the giant 's body , when the monster gave a groan and expired .
18 The knight and his lady thanked Jack for their deliverance , and invited him to their house , to receive a proper reward for his services .
19 `` No , '' said Jack , `` I can not be easy till I find out this monster 's habitation . ''
20 So , taking the knight 's directions , he mounted his horse and soon after came in sight of another giant , who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brother 's return .
21 Jack alighted from his horse , and , putting on his invisible coat , approached and aimed a blow at the XXXXX 's head , but , missing his aim , he only cut off his nose .	giant		bag|body|fellow|giant|head|lady|length|monster|services|slaps

1 Pray how did you sleep last night ?
2 Did you hear or see anything in the dead of the night ? ''
3 `` Nothing to speak of , '' said Jack , carelessly ; `` a rat , I believe , gave me three or four slaps with its tail , and disturbed me a little ; but I soon went to sleep again . ''
4 The giant wondered more and more at this ; yet he did not answer a word , but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast .
5 Jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as himself , so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat , and slip the hasty-pudding into this bag , while he seemed to put it into his mouth .
6 When breakfast was over he said to the giant : `` Now I will show you a fine trick .
7 I can cure all wounds with a touch ; I could cut off my head in one minute , and the next put it sound again on my shoulders .
8 You shall see an example . ''
9 He then took hold of the knife , ripped up the leathern bag , and all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor .
10 `` Ods splutter hur nails ! ''
11 cried the Welsh giant , who was ashamed to be outdone by such a little fellow as Jack , `` hur can do that hurself '' ; so he snatched up the knife , plunged it into his own stomach , and in a moment dropped down dead .

2 Jack alighted from his horse , and tying him to an oak tree , put on his invisible coat , under which he carried his sword of sharpness .

1 A ' night she kept sighing and singing as before : `` Seven lang years I served for thee , '' & c. Still he sleepit , and she nearly lost hope a ` thegither .
2 But that day when he was out at the hunting , somebody asked him what noise and moaning was yon they heard all last night in his bedchamber .
3 He said he heardna ony noise .
4 But they assured him there was sae ; and he resolved to keep waking that night to try what he could hear .
5 That being the third night , and the damosel being between hope and despair , she brak her plum , and it held far the richest jewelry of the three .
6 She bargained as before ; and the auld wife , as before , took in the sleeping-drink to the young knight 's chamber ; but he telled her he couldna drink it that night without sweetening .
7 And when she gaed awa ' for some honey to sweeten it wi ' , he poured out the drink , and sae made the auld wife think he had drunk it .
8 They a ' went to bed again , and the damosel began , as before , singing : `` Seven lang years I served for thee , The glassy hill I clamb for thee , The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee ; And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me ? ''
9 He heard , and turned to her .
10 And she telled him a ' that had befa'en her , and he telled her a ' that had happened to him .
11 And he caused the auld washerwife and her dochter to be burned .
12 And they were married , and he and she are living happy till this day , for aught I ken .

14 THE RED ETIN There were ance twa widows that lived on a small bit o ' ground , which they rented from a farmer .
15 Ane of them had twa sons , and the other had ane ; and by-and-by it was time for the wife that had twa sons to send them away to seeke their fortune .
16 So she told her eldest son ae day to take a can and bring her water from the well , that she might bake a cake for him ; and however much or however little water he might bring , the cake would be great or sma ' accordingly ; and that cake was to be a ' that she could gie him when he went on his travels .
17 The lad gaed away wi ' the can to the well , and filled it wi ' water , and then came away hame again ; but the can being broken the maist part of the water had run out before he got back .
18 So his cake was very sma ' ; yet sma ' as it was , his mother asked if he was willing to take the half of it with her blessing , telling him that , if he chose rather to have the hale , he would only get it wi ' her curse .
