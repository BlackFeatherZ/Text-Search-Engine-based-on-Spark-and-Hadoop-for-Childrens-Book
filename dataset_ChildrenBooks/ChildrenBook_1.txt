14 Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls .
15 `` You have asked all the right people , my dear ? ''

2 on every seat was a lovely fairy , dressed in green , each with a most interesting-looking parcel in her hand .

5 But the queen , though she saw them distinctly , took no notice of them .
6 You see , she did not believe in fairies , nor in her own eyes , when she saw them .
7 So she talked across the fairies to the king , just as if they had not been there ; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which , of course , they were .
8 When dinner was over , and when the nurse had brought in the baby , all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents .
9 One offered a purse which could never be empty ; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots ; and another a cap of darkness , that nobody might see the prince when he put it on ; and another a wishing-cap ; and another a carpet , on which , when he sat , he was carried wherever he wished to find himself .
10 Another made him beautiful for ever ; and another , brave ; and another , lucky : but the last fairy of all , a cross old thing , crept up and said , `` My child , you shall be too clever ! ''

3 -LCB- Prigio reading a book : p11.jpg -RCB- Indeed , I can not tell you how the prince was hated by all !
4 He would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup .
5 He would visit the poor people 's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum-pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon .
6 He showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers .
7 He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does .
8 The young ladies of the Court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? ''
9 and `` Have you read that ? ''
10 -- and when they said they had n't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out .
11 He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife .
12 He also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !
13 In fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he was never in the wrong , and he always said , `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''
14 And , what was more , he had !
15 As time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked .
16 They were not a bit clever , but jolly .
17 Prince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion .
18 Prince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever .
19 Both were in love with two of their own cousins -LRB- with the approval of their dear parents -RRB- ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''
20 But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .
21 Now , as Pantouflia was a rich , lazy XXXXX , which hated fighting , this was very unpleasant , and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better .	country		bit|country|looks|parents|part|people|rage|son|spite|terriers

4 He would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup .
5 He would visit the poor people 's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum-pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon .
6 He showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers .
7 He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does .
8 The young ladies of the Court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? ''
9 and `` Have you read that ? ''
10 -- and when they said they had n't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out .
11 He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife .
12 He also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !
13 In fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he was never in the wrong , and he always said , `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''
14 And , what was more , he had !
15 As time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked .
16 They were not a bit clever , but jolly .
17 Prince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion .
18 Prince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever .
19 Both were in love with two of their own cousins -LRB- with the approval of their dear parents -RRB- ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''
20 But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .

4 And he grew so fierce , that even the queen was afraid of him now .
5 The poor queen cried a good deal ; Prigio being her favourite son , on account of his acknowledged ability and talent .
6 But the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio behind .
7 For his part , he , very good-naturedly , showed them the best and shortest road to Falkenstein , the city where they were going ; and easily proved that neither the chief secretary for geography , nor the general of the army , knew anything about the matter -- which , indeed , they did not .
8 The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells , for they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day .
9 He therefore reminded them of this little fact in future history , which made them feel uncomfortable enough , and then lay down in his hammock and went to sleep .
10 When he wakened , the air was cold and the day was beginning to grow dark .
11 Prince Prigio thought he would go down and dine at a tavern in the town , for no servants had been left with him .
12 But what was his annoyance when he found that his boots , his sword , his cap , his cloak -- all his clothes , in fact , except those he wore , -- had been taken away by the courtiers , merely to spite him !
13 His wardrobe had been ransacked , and everything that had not been carried off had been cut up , burned , and destroyed .
14 Never was such a spectacle of wicked mischief .
15 It was as if hay had been made of everything he possessed .
16 What was worse , he had not a penny in his pocket to buy new things ; and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month .
17 Can you imagine anything more cruel and unjust than this conduct ?
18 for it was not the prince 's fault that he was so clever .
19 The cruel fairy had made him so .
20 But , even if the prince had been born clever -LRB- as may have happened to you -RRB- , was he to be blamed for that ?

1 Well , here was the prince in a pretty plight .
2 Not a pound in his pocket , not a pair of boots to wear , not even a cap to cover his head from the rain ; nothing but cold meat to eat , and never a servant to answer the bell .
3 CHAPTER V. What Prince Prigio found in the Garret .
4 The prince walked from room to room of the palace ; but , unless he wrapped himself up in a curtain , there was nothing for him to wear when he went out in the rain .
5 At last he climbed up a turret-stair in the very oldest part of the castle , where he had never been before ; and at the very top was a little round room , a kind of garret .
6 The prince pushed in the door with some difficulty -- not that it was locked , but the handle was rusty , and the wood had swollen with the damp .
7 The room was very dark ; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window , one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times .
8 But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the floor and on the table .
9 There were two caps ; he put one on -- an old , grey , ugly cap it was , made of felt .
10 There was a pair of boots ; and he kicked off his slippers , and got into them .
11 They were a good deal worn , but fitted as if they had been made for him .
12 On the table was a purse with just three gold coins -- old ones , too -- in it ; and this , as you may fancy , the prince was very well pleased to put in his pocket .
13 A sword , with a sword-belt , he buckled about his waist ; and the rest of the articles , a regular collection of odds and ends , he left just where they were lying .

2 The town was just three miles off ; but he had such a royal appetite , that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery , and the people of the royal town were bad cooks .
3 `` I wish I were in ` The Bear , ' at Gluckstein , '' said he to himself ; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there .
4 But , then , the town was twenty-one leagues away -- sixty-three long miles !
5 No sooner had the prince said this , and taken just three steps , than he found himself at the door of the `` Bear Inn '' at Gluckstein !

3 The Prince Falls in Love .
4 He understood all this , and burst out laughing , which nearly frightened an old lady near him out of her wits .
5 Ah !
6 how he wished he was only in evening dress , that he might dance with the charming young lady .
7 But there he was , dressed just as if he were going out to hunt , if anyone could have seen him .
8 So , even if he took off his cap of darkness , and became visible , he was no figure for a ball .
9 Once he would not have cared , but now he cared very much indeed .
10 But the prince was not clever for nothing .
11 He thought for a moment , then went out of the room , and , in three steps of the seven-league boots , was at his empty , dark , cold palace again .
12 He struck a light with a flint and steel , lit a torch , and ran upstairs to the garret .
13 The flaring light of the torch fell on the pile of `` rubbish , '' as the queen would have called it , which he turned over with eager hands .
14 Was there -- yes , there was another cap !
15 There it lay , a handsome green one with a red feather .
16 The prince pulled off the cap of darkness , put on the other , and said : '' I wish I were dressed in my best suit of white and gold , with the royal Pantouflia diamonds ! ''
17 In one moment there he was in white and gold , the greatest and most magnificent dandy in the whole world , and the handsomest man !
18 `` How about my boots , I wonder , '' said the prince ; for his seven-league boots were stout riding-boots , not good to dance in , whereas now he was in elegant shoes of silk and gold .
19 He threw down the wishing cap , put on the other -- the cap of darkness -- and made three strides in the direction of Gluckstein .
20 But he was only three steps nearer it than he had been , and the seven-league boots were standing beside him on the floor !
21 `` No , '' said the prince ; `` no XXXXX can be in two different pairs of boots at one and the same time !	man		CHAPTER|cap|dress|hunt|lady|man|one|queen|room|steps

20 or Julius Caesar , or Michael Angelo , or whoever it might be -- horrid , difficult questions he used to ask .

17 or , `` What !
18 you never heard of Alexander the Great ? ''
19 or Julius Caesar , or Michael Angelo , or whoever it might be -- horrid , difficult questions he used to ask .
20 That was the way he used to go on : but now he only talked to the young lady about herself ; and she quite left off being shy or frightened , and asked him all about his own country , and about the Firedrake-shooting , and said how fond she was of hunting herself .

7 That was the way he used to go on : but now he only talked to the young lady about herself ; and she quite left off being shy or frightened , and asked him all about his own country , and about the Firedrake-shooting , and said how fond she was of hunting herself .
8 And the prince said : `` Oh , if you wish it , you shall have the horns and tail of a Firedrake to hang up in your hall , to-morrow evening ! ''
9 Then she asked if it was not very dangerous work , Firedrake hunting ; and he said it was nothing , when you knew the trick of it : and he asked her if she would but give him a rose out of her bouquet ; and , in short , he made himself so agreeable and unaffected , that she thought him very nice indeed .
10 For , even a clever person can be nice when he likes -- above all , when he is not thinking about himself .
11 And now the prince was thinking of nothing in the world but the daughter of the English ambassador , and how to please her .
12 He got introduced to her father too , and quite won his heart ; and , at last , he was invited to dine next day at the Embassy .
13 In Pantouflia , it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the royal family goes on dancing .
14 This ball lasted till the light came in , and the birds were singing out of doors , and all the mothers present were sound asleep .
15 Then nothing would satisfy the prince , but that they all should go home singing through the streets ; in fact , there never had been so merry a dance in all Pantouflia .
16 The prince had made a point of dancing with almost every girl there : and he had suddenly become the most beloved of the royal family .
17 But everything must end at last ; and the prince , putting on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet , flew back to his lonely castle .

1 Then they sat out in the conservatory , among the flowers , where nobody came near them ; and then they danced again , and then the Prince took her down to supper .
2 And all the time he never once said , `` Have you read this ? ''

13 It was bright daylight , and he had promised to bring the horns and tail of a Firedrake as a present to a pretty lady .
14 He had said it was easy to do this ; but now , as he sat and thought over it , he did not feel so victorious .
15 `` First , '' he said , `` where is the Firedrake ? ''
16 He reflected for a little , and then ran upstairs to the garret .
17 `` It should be here ! ''
18 he cried , tossing the fairies ' gifts about ; `` and , by George , here it is ! ''
19 Indeed , he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which Prince Ali , in the Arabian Nights , bought in the bazaar in Schiraz .
20 Now , this glass was made so that , by looking through it , you could see anybody or anything you wished , however far away .
