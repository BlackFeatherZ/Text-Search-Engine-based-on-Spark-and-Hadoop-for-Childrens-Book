1 Bidding the tradesmen enter , he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things : an old cap or two , a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion , an old broadsword , a shabby old Persian rug , an ivory spy - glass , and other articles .
2 These were , in fact , the fairy presents , which had been given to the king at his christening , and by aid of which -LRB- and his natural acuteness -RRB- he had , in his youth , succeeded in many remarkable adventures .
3 The caps were the Wishing Cap and the Cap of Darkness .
4 The rug was the famous carpet which carried its owner through the air wherever he wished to go .
5 The sword was the Sword of Sharpness .
6 The ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to see , however far off .
7 The boots were the Seven-league Boots , which Hop-o ' - my-Thumb stole from the Ogre about 1697 .
8 There were other valuable objects , but these were the most useful and celebrated .
9 Of course the king did not tell the tradesmen what they were .
10 `` Now , gentlemen , '' said his Majesty , `` you see these old things .
11 For reasons which I must ask you to excuse me for keeping to myself , I wish you to provide me with objects exactly and precisely similar to these , with all the look of age . ''
12 The tradesmen examined the objects , each choosing that in his own line of business .
13 `` As to the sword , sire , '' said the cutler , `` it is an Andrea Ferrara , a fine old blade .
14 By a lucky accident , I happen to have one at home in a small collection of ancient weapons , exactly like it .
15 This evening it shall be at your Majesty 's disposal . ''
16 `` Perhaps , Herr Schnitzler , you will kindly write an order for it , as I wish no one of you to leave the palace , if you can conveniently stay , till your business is finished . ''

1 On this the swordmaker took out and exhibited the Andrea Ferrara blade , which was exactly like the Sword of Sharpness .
2 The upholsterer undid his parcel , and there was a Persian rug , which no one could tell from the magical carpet .
3 The hatter was fumbling with the string of his parcel , when he suddenly remembered , what the king in his astonishment had not noticed , that he had a cap on himself .
4 He pulled it off in a hurry , and the king at once saw that it was his Wishing Cap , and understood all about the affair .
5 The hatter , in his absence , had tried on the Wishing Cap , and had wished that he himself and his friends were all at home and back again with their wares at the palace .
6 And what he wished happened , of course , as was natural .
7 In a moment the king saw how much talk this business would produce in the country , and he decided on the best way to stop it .
8 Seizing the Wishing Cap , he put it on , wished all the tradesmen , including the shoemaker , back in the town at their shops , and also wished that none of them should remember anything about the whole affair .
9 In a moment he was alone in the turret-room .
10 As for the shopkeepers , they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed something odd ; but , as it went no further , of course they did not talk about it , and nobody was any the wiser .
11 `` Owl that I am ! ''
12 said King Prigio to himself .
13 `` I might have better wished for a complete set of sham fairy things which would not work .
14 It would have saved a great deal of trouble ; but I am so much out of the habit of using the cap , that I never thought of it .
15 However , what I have got will do very well . ''
16 Then , putting on the Cap of Darkness , that nobody might see him , he carried all the real fairy articles away , except the Seven-league Boots , to his own room , where he locked them up , leaving in their place the sham Wishing Cap , the sham Cap of Darkness , the sham Sword of Sharpness , and the carpet which was not a magic carpet at all .
17 His idea was , of course , that Ricardo would start on an expedition confiding in his fairy things , and he would find that they did not act .
18 Then he would be left to his own cleverness and courage to get him out of the scrape .
19 That would teach him , thought the king , to depend on himself , and to set a proper value on cleverness and learning , and minding his book .
20 Of course he might have locked the things up , and forbidden Ricardo to touch them , but that might have seemed harsh .
21 And , as you may easily imagine , with all the powers at his command , the XXXXX fancied he could easily rescue Ricardo from any very serious danger at the hands of giants or magicians or monsters .	king		friends|home|king|nobody|palace|scrape|shopkeepers|string|talk|town

15 Ricardo then , after a few words of courtesy on both parts , picked up his useless carpet , took his farewell of the royal party , and , with Jaqueline still hidden under his collar , returned at full speed , but with a heavy heart , to Pantouflia , where the palace gong was just sounding for luncheon .

11 His Majesty was very much moved .
12 `` What extraordinary bad luck that family has ! ''
13 he thought .
14 `` If I had not changed the rug , the merest accident , Prince Charles would have dined at St. James 's to-night , and King George in Hanover .
15 It was the very nearest thing ! ''
16 `` This meddling with practical affairs will never do , '' he said aloud .
17 `` Dick has had a lesson , sire , '' said the princess .
18 `` He says he 'll never mix himself up with politics again , whatever happens .
19 And he says he means to study all about them , for he feels frightfully ignorant , and , above all , he means to practise his fencing . ''

18 The prince rode and rode , sometimes taking up Pepper on his saddle ; passing through forests , sleeping at lonely inns , fording rivers , till one day he saw that the air was becoming Yellow .
19 He knew that this showed the neighbourhood of Jaunia , or Daunia , the country of the Yellow Dwarf .
20 He therefore drew bridle , placed his rose-coloured spectacles on his nose and put spurs to his horse , for the yellow light of Jaunia makes people melancholy and cowardly .

1 But , being in the shop of the optician that day , standing with his back to the door , he heard Dick come in and order a pair of rose-coloured spectacles , with which he was at once provided .
2 The people of Pantouflia were accustomed to wear them , saying that they improved the complexions of ladies whom they met , and added cheerfulness to things in general .
3 `` Just plain rose-coloured glass , Herr Spex , '' said Dick , `` I 'm not short - sighted . ''
4 `` The boy is beginning to show some sense , '' said the king to himself , knowing the nature and the difficulties of the expedition .
5 Ricardo did not disguise his intention of taking with him a Dandie Dinmont terrier , named Pepper , and the king , who understood the motive of this precaution , silently approved .
6 `` The lad has come to some purpose and forethought , '' the king said , and he gladly advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of crocodiles ' eggs , which can rarely be got quite fresh .
7 When Jaqueline had made the crocodiles ' eggs , with millet-seed and sugar-candy , into a cake for the Dwarf 's lions , Ricardo announced that his preparations were complete .
8 Not to be the mere slave of custom , he made this expedition on horseback , and the only magical thing he took with him was the Cap of Darkness -LRB- the one which would not work , but he did not know that -RRB- , and this he put in his pocket for future use .
9 With plenty of egg sandwiches and marmalade sandwiches , and cold minced-collop sandwiches , he pricked forth into the wilderness , making for the country inhabited by the Yellow Dwarf .
10 The princess was glad he was riding , for she privately accompanied him in the disguise of a wasp ; and a wasp , of course , could not have kept up with him in his Seven-league Boots .
11 `` Hang that wops ! ''
12 said Prince Ricardo several times , buffeting it with his pocket-handkerchief when it buzzed in his ear and round his horse 's head .
13 -LCB- `` Hang that wops ! ''
14 said Prince Ricardo : p129.jpg -RCB- Meanwhile , King Prigio had taken his precautions , which were perfectly simple .
15 When he thought Ricardo was getting near the place , the king put on his Wishing Cap , sat down before the magic crystal ball , and kept his eye on the proceedings , being ready to wish the right thing to help Ricardo at the right moment .
16 He left the window wide open , smoked his cigar , and seemed the pattern of a good and wise father watching the conduct of a promising son .
17 The prince rode and rode , sometimes taking up Pepper on his saddle ; passing through forests , sleeping at lonely inns , fording rivers , till one day he saw that the air was becoming Yellow .
18 He knew that this showed the neighbourhood of Jaunia , or Daunia , the country of the Yellow Dwarf .
