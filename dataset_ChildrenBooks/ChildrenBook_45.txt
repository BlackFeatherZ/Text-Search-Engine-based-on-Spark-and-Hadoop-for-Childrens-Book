1 The dead man was so astonished at this behaviour , that he peeped out of a little window in the side of the coffin , and cried out : ' I should laugh as loudly as any of you , if I were not a dead man . '
2 When they heard the voice coming from the coffin the other people suddenly stopped laughing , and stood as if they had been turned into stone .
3 Then they rushed with one accord to the coffin , and lifted the lid so that the man could step out amongst them .
4 ` Were you really not dead after all ? '
5 asked they .
6 ` And if not , why did you let yourself be buried ? '
7 At this the wives both confessed that they had each wished to prove that her husband was stupider than the other .
8 But the villagers declared that they could not decide which was the most foolish -- the man who allowed himself to be persuaded that he was wearing fine clothes when he was dressed in nothing , or the man who let himself be buried when he was alive and well .
9 So the women quarrelled just as much as they did before , and no one ever knew whose husband was the most foolish .

11 Asmund and Signy Long , long ago , in the days when fairies , witches , giants and ogres still visited the earth , there lived a king who reigned over a great and beautiful country .
12 He was married to a wife whom he dearly loved , and had two most promising children -- a son called Asmund , and a daughter who was named Signy .
13 The king and queen were very anxious to bring their children up well , and the young prince and princess were taught everything likely to make them clever and accomplished .
14 They lived at home in their father 's palace , and he spared no pains to make their lives happy .
15 Prince Asmund dearly loved all outdoor sports and an open-air life , and from his earliest childhood he had longed to live entirely in the forest close by .
16 After many arguments and entreaties he succeeded in persuading the king to give him two great oak trees for his very own .
17 ` Now , ' said he to his sister , ' I will have the trees hollowed out , and then I will make rooms in them and furnish them so that I shall be able to live out in the forest . '

1 Unfortunately sadder days were to come .
2 A war with another country broke out , and the king had to lead his army against their enemy .
3 During his absence the queen fell ill , and after lingering for some time she died , to the great grief of her children .
4 They made up their minds to live altogether for a time in their trees , and for this purpose they had provisions enough stored up inside to last them a year .
5 Now , I must tell you , in another country a long way off , there reigned a king who had an only son named Ring .
6 Prince Ring had heard so much about the beauty and goodness of Princess Signy that he determined to marry her if possible .
7 So he begged his father to let him have a ship for the voyage , set sail with a favourable wind , and after a time landed in the country where Signy lived .
8 The prince lost no time in setting out for the royal palace , and on his way there he met such a wonderfully lovely woman that he felt he had never seen such beauty in all his life .
9 He stopped her and at once asked who she was . '
10 I am Signy , the king 's daughter , ' was the reply .
11 Then the prince inquired why she was wandering about all by herself , and she told him that since her mother 's death she was so sad that whilst her father was away she preferred being alone .
12 Ring was quite deceived by her , and never guessed that she was not Princess Signy at all , but a strong , gigantic , wicked witch bent on deceiving him under a beautiful shape .
13 He confided to her that he had travelled all the way from his own country for her sake , having fallen in love with the accounts he had heard of her beauty , and he then and there asked her to be his wife .
14 The witch listened to all he said and , much pleased , ended by accepting his offer ; but she begged him to return to his ship for a little while as she wished to go some way further into the forest , promising to join him later on .

19 The false Signy was also very kindly welcomed .
20 A beautiful house was got ready for her , and Prince Ring had the two oaks planted in the garden just in front of her windows so that she might have the pleasure of seeing them constantly .

2 ` Then , ' replied Ring , ` let us decide on this day fortnight .
3 And see , I have brought you some stuff to make your wedding-dress of . '
4 So saying he gave her a large piece of the most beautiful brocade , all woven over with gold threads , and embroidered with pearls and other jewels .
5 The prince had hardly left her before the witch resumed her proper shape and tore about the room , raging and storming and flinging the beautiful silk on the floor .
6 ` What was SHE to do with such things ? '
7 she roared .
8 ` SHE did not know how to sew or make clothes , and she was sure to die of starvation into the bargain if her brother Ironhead did not come soon and bring her some raw meat and bones , for she really could eat nothing else . '
9 As she was raving and roaring in this frantic manner part of the floor suddenly opened and a huge giant rose up carrying a great chest in his arms .
10 The witch was enchanted at this sight , and eagerly helped her brother to set down and open the chest , which was full of the ghastly food she had been longing for .
11 The horrid pair set to and greedily devoured it all , and when the chest was quite empty the giant put it on his shoulder and disappeared as he had come , without leaving any trace of his visit .
12 But his sister did not keep quiet for long , and tore and pulled at the rich brocade as if she wanted to destroy it , stamping about and shouting angrily .
13 Now , all this time Prince Asmund and his sister sat in their trees just outside the window and saw all that was going on .
14 ` Dear Signy , ' said Asmund , ` do try to get hold of that piece of brocade and make the clothes yourself , for really we shall have no rest day or night with such a noise . ' '
15 I will try , ' said Signy ; ` it wo n't be an easy matter , but it 's worth while taking some trouble to have a little peace . '
16 So she watched for an opportunity and managed to carry off the brocade the first time the witch left her room .
17 Then she set to work , cutting out and sewing as best she could , and by the end of six days she had turned it into an elegant robe with a long train and a mantle .
18 When it was finished she climbed to the top of her tree and contrived to throw the clothes on to a table through the open window .
19 How delighted the witch was when she found the clothes all finished !
20 The next time Prince Ring came to see her she gave them to him , and he paid her many compliments on her skilful work , after which he took leave of her in the most friendly manner .

1 ` SHE did not know how to sew or make clothes , and she was sure to die of starvation into the bargain if her brother Ironhead did not come soon and bring her some raw meat and bones , for she really could eat nothing else . '
2 As she was raving and roaring in this frantic manner part of the floor suddenly opened and a huge giant rose up carrying a great chest in his arms .
3 The witch was enchanted at this sight , and eagerly helped her brother to set down and open the chest , which was full of the ghastly food she had been longing for .
4 The horrid pair set to and greedily devoured it all , and when the chest was quite empty the giant put it on his shoulder and disappeared as he had come , without leaving any trace of his visit .
5 But his sister did not keep quiet for long , and tore and pulled at the rich brocade as if she wanted to destroy it , stamping about and shouting angrily .
6 Now , all this time Prince Asmund and his sister sat in their trees just outside the window and saw all that was going on .
7 ` Dear Signy , ' said Asmund , ` do try to get hold of that piece of brocade and make the clothes yourself , for really we shall have no rest day or night with such a noise . ' '
8 I will try , ' said Signy ; ` it wo n't be an easy matter , but it 's worth while taking some trouble to have a little peace . '
9 So she watched for an opportunity and managed to carry off the brocade the first time the witch left her room .
10 Then she set to work , cutting out and sewing as best she could , and by the end of six days she had turned it into an elegant robe with a long train and a mantle .
11 When it was finished she climbed to the top of her tree and contrived to throw the clothes on to a table through the open window .
12 How delighted the witch was when she found the clothes all finished !
13 The next time Prince Ring came to see her she gave them to him , and he paid her many compliments on her skilful work , after which he took leave of her in the most friendly manner .

15 When Asmund saw all these wild doings from his tree he felt he could no longer keep silence .
16 He went to Prince Ring and said : ` Do come with me and see the strange things that are happening in the new princess 's room . '
17 The prince was not a little surprised , but he consented to hide himself with Asmund behind the panelling of the room , from where they could see all that went on through a little slit .
18 The witch was raving and roaring as usual , and said to her brother : ` Once I am married to the king 's son I shall be better off than now .

18 So he stole into the valley , keeping himself carefully hidden in copse or hedgerow , and very soon met with an adventure ; for , peeping through a screen of leaves , he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden , fresh as the spring , and beautiful to look upon .
19 Around her upon the grass lay her young companions , as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game .

1 Rubezahl Over all the vast under-world the mountain Gnome Rubezahl was lord ; and busy enough the care of his dominions kept him .
2 There were the endless treasure chambers to be gone through , and the hosts of gnomes to be kept to their tasks .
3 Some built strong barriers to hold back the fiery vapours to change dull stones to precious metal , or were hard at work filling every cranny of the rocks with diamonds and rubies ; for Rubezahl loved all pretty things .
4 Sometimes the fancy would take him to leave those gloomy regions , and come out upon the green earth for a while , and bask in the sunshine and hear the birds sing .
5 And as gnomes live many hundreds of years he saw strange things .
6 For , the first time he came up , the great hills were covered with thick forests , in which wild animals roamed , and Rubezahl watched the fierce fights between bear and bison , or chased the grey wolves , or amused himself by rolling great rocks down into the desolate valleys , to hear the thunder of their fall echoing among the hills .
7 But the next time he ventured above ground , what was his surprise to find everything changed !
8 The dark woods were hewn down , and in their place appeared blossoming orchards surrounding cosy-looking thatched cottages ; for every chimney the blue smoke curled peacefully into the air , sheep and oxen fed in the flowery meadows , while from the shade of the hedges came the music of the shepherd 's pipe .
9 The strangeness and pleasantness of the sight so delighted the gnome that he never thought of resenting the intrusion of these unexpected guests , who , without saying ` by your leave ' or ` with your leave , ' had made themselves so very much at home upon is hills ; nor did he wish to interfere with their doings , but left them in quiet possession of their homes , as a good householder leaves in peace the swallows who have built their nests under his eaves .
10 He was indeed greatly minded to make friends with this being called ` man , ' so , taking the form of an old field labourer , he entered the service of a farmer .
11 Under his care all the crops flourished exceedingly , but the master proved to be wasteful and ungrateful , and Rubezahl soon left him , and went to be shepherd to his next neighbour .
12 He tended the flock so diligently , and knew so well where to lead the sheep to the sweetest pastures , and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away , that they too prospered under his care , and not one was lost or torn by wolves ; but this new master was a hard man , and begrudged him his well-earned wages .
13 So he ran away and went to serve the judge .
14 Here he upheld the law with might and main , and was a terror to thieves and evildoers ; but the judge was a bad man , who took bribes , and despised the law .
15 Rubezahl would not be the tool of an unjust man , and so he told his master , who thereupon ordered him to be thrown in prison .
16 Of course that did not trouble the gnome at all , he simply got out through the keyhole , and went away down to his underground palace , very much disappointed by his first experience of mankind .
17 But , as time went on , he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him , and thought he would take another look at the upper world .
18 So he stole into the valley , keeping himself carefully hidden in copse or hedgerow , and very soon met with an adventure ; for , peeping through a screen of leaves , he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden , fresh as the spring , and beautiful to look upon .
19 Around her upon the grass lay her young companions , as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game .

19 The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster ; the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed , flowed in silence now in its smooth channel , from which a clear fountain leapt , to fall again in showers of diamond drops , now on this side now on that , as the wandering breeze scattered it .
20 Daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink , while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round , making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable .
21 To the right and left of the XXXXX opened out a wonderful grotto , its walls and arches glittering with many-coloured rock-crystals , while in every niche were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats , the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them .	waterfall		bed|foot|forest|love|plan|rest|rock|things|tree|waterfall

7 But , as time went on , he forgot the disagreeable things that had happened to him , and thought he would take another look at the upper world .
8 So he stole into the valley , keeping himself carefully hidden in copse or hedgerow , and very soon met with an adventure ; for , peeping through a screen of leaves , he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden , fresh as the spring , and beautiful to look upon .
9 Around her upon the grass lay her young companions , as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game .
10 Beyond them flowed a little brook , into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock , filling the air with its pleasant sound , and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide .
11 The sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that , for the first time , he wished himself a mortal ; and , longing for a better view of the gay company , he changed himself into a raven and perched upon an oaktree which overhung the brook .
12 But he soon found that this was not at all a good plan .
13 He could only see with a raven 's eyes , and feel as a raven feels ; and a nest of field-mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens .
14 When he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket , and took the form of a handsome young man -- that was the best way -- and he fell in love with the girl then and there .
15 The fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country , and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits , till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn by the brook to rest , or to bathe in the cool waters .
16 On this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood .
17 This was Master Rubezahl 's opportunity .
18 Stepping out of his hiding-place he stood in the midst of the little lawn , weaving his magic spells , till slowly all about him changed , and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting-place they stood lost in amazement , and almost fancied that they must be dreaming .
19 The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster ; the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed , flowed in silence now in its smooth channel , from which a clear fountain leapt , to fall again in showers of diamond drops , now on this side now on that , as the wandering breeze scattered it .
20 Daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink , while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round , making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable .
21 To the right and left of the waterfall opened out a wonderful grotto , its walls and arches glittering with many-coloured rock-crystals , while in every niche were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats , the very XXXXX of which made the princess long to taste them .	sight		eyes|maiden|man|rest|rock|rocks|sight|sound|way|wolves

1 He tended the flock so diligently , and knew so well where to lead the sheep to the sweetest pastures , and where among the hills to look for any who strayed away , that they too prospered under his care , and not one was lost or torn by wolves ; but this new master was a hard man , and begrudged him his well-earned wages .

1 So he stole into the valley , keeping himself carefully hidden in copse or hedgerow , and very soon met with an adventure ; for , peeping through a screen of leaves , he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden , fresh as the spring , and beautiful to look upon .
2 Around her upon the grass lay her young companions , as if they had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game .
3 Beyond them flowed a little brook , into which a waterfall leapt from a high rock , filling the air with its pleasant sound , and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide .
4 The sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that , for the first time , he wished himself a mortal ; and , longing for a better view of the gay company , he changed himself into a raven and perched upon an oaktree which overhung the brook .
5 But he soon found that this was not at all a good plan .
6 He could only see with a raven 's eyes , and feel as a raven feels ; and a nest of field-mice at the foot of the tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens .
7 When he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket , and took the form of a handsome young man -- that was the best way -- and he fell in love with the girl then and there .

11 Stepping out of his hiding-place he stood in the midst of the little lawn , weaving his magic spells , till slowly all about him changed , and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting-place they stood lost in amazement , and almost fancied that they must be dreaming .
12 The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster ; the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed , flowed in silence now in its smooth channel , from which a clear fountain leapt , to fall again in showers of diamond drops , now on this side now on that , as the wandering breeze scattered it .
13 Daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink , while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round , making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable .
14 To the right and left of the waterfall opened out a wonderful grotto , its walls and arches glittering with many-coloured rock-crystals , while in every niche were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats , the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them .

1 The fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country , and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits , till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn by the brook to rest , or to bathe in the cool waters .
2 On this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood .
3 This was Master Rubezahl 's opportunity .
4 Stepping out of his hiding-place he stood in the midst of the little lawn , weaving his magic spells , till slowly all about him changed , and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting-place they stood lost in amazement , and almost fancied that they must be dreaming .
5 The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster ; the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed , flowed in silence now in its smooth channel , from which a clear fountain leapt , to fall again in showers of diamond drops , now on this side now on that , as the wandering breeze scattered it .
6 Daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink , while tall hedges of roses and jasmine ringed it round , making the sweetest and daintiest bower imaginable .
7 To the right and left of the waterfall opened out a wonderful grotto , its walls and arches glittering with many-coloured rock-crystals , while in every niche were spread out strange fruits and sweetmeats , the very sight of which made the princess long to taste them .
8 She hesitated a while , however , scarcely able to believe her eyes , and not knowing if she should enter the enchanted spot or fly from it .

1 But at length curiosity prevailed , and she and her companions explored to their heart 's content , and tasted and examined everything , running hither and thither in high glee , and calling merrily to each other .
2 At last , when they were quite weary , the princess cried out suddenly that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool , which certainly did look very inviting ; and they all went gaily to this new amusement .
3 The princess was ready first , but scarcely had she slipped over the rim of the pool when down -- down -- down she sank , and vanished in its depths before her frightened playmates could seize her by so much as a lock of her floating golden hair !
4 Loudly did they weep and wail , running about the brink of the pool , which looked so shallow and so clear , but which had swallowed up their princess before their eyes .
5 They even sprang into the water and tried to dive after her , but in vain ; they only floated like corks in the enchanted pool , and could not keep under water for a second .
6 They saw at last that there was nothing for it but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughter 's disappearance .
7 And what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told !
8 The king tore his robes , dashed his golden crown from his head , and hid his face in his purple mantle for grief and anguish at the loss of the princess .
9 After the first outburst of wailing , however , he took heart and hurried off to see for himself the scene of this strange adventure , thinking , as people will in sorrow , that there might be some mistake after all .
10 But when he reached the spot , behold , all was changed again !
11 The glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished , and so had the marble bath , the bower of jasmine ; instead , all was a tangle of flowers , as it had been of old .
12 The king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princess 's playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not confess something about her disappearance ; but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some sprite or goblin , and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt ; for kings can not bear to be troubled about anything long .
13 Meanwhile the princess was not at all unhappy in the palace of her elfish lover .
14 When the water-nymphs , who were hiding in readiness , had caught her and dragged her out of the sight of her terrified maidens , she herself had not had time to be frightened .
15 They swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her father 's seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it , and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch , wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle , while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear .
16 The gnome , for he it was , told her all about himself and his great underground kingdom , and presently led her through the many rooms and halls of the palace , and showed her the rare and wonderful things displayed in them till she was fairly dazzled at the sight of so much splendour .

6 The fruit trees were hung with golden and rosy apples , and nightingales sang in every bush , as the gnome and the princess wandered in the leafy alleys , sometimes gazing at the moon , sometimes pausing to gather the rarest flowers for her adornment .
7 And all the time he was thinking to himself that never , during the hundreds of years he had lived , had he seen so charming a maiden .
8 But the princess felt no such happiness ; in spite of all the magic delights around her she was sad , though she tried to seem content for fear of displeasing the gnome .
9 However , he soon perceived her melancholy , and in a thousand ways strove to dispel the cloud , but in vain .
10 At last he said to himself : ` Men are sociable creatures , like bees or ants .
11 Doubtless this lovely mortal is pining for company .
12 Who is there I can find for her to talk to ? '
13 Thereupon he hastened into the nearest filed and dug up a dozen or so of different roots -- carrots , turnips , and radishes -- and laying them carefully in an elegant basket brought them to the princess , who sat pensive in the shade of the rose-bower .
14 ` Loveliest daughter of earth , ' said the gnome , ` banish all sorrow ; no more shall you be lonely in my dwelling .
15 In this basket is all you need to make this spot delightful to you .
16 Take this little many-coloured wand , and with a touch give to each root the form you desire to see . '
17 With this he left her , and the princess , without an instant 's delay , opened the basket , and touching a turnip , cried eagerly : ` Brunhilda , my dear Brunhilda !
18 come to me quickly ! '
19 And sure enough there was Brunhilda , joyfully hugging and kissing her beloved princess , and chattering as gaily as in the old days .
20 This sudden appearance was so delightful that the princess could hardly believe her own eyes , and was quite beside herself with the joy of having her dear playfellow with her once more .
21 Hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden , and gathered the golden apples from the trees , and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful XXXXX of the palace , until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments the gnome had given to his hoped-for bride .	rooms		bees|carrots|cloud|delay|gnome|rooms|sight|things|time|ways

2 When the water-nymphs , who were hiding in readiness , had caught her and dragged her out of the sight of her terrified maidens , she herself had not had time to be frightened .
3 They swam with her quickly by strange underground ways to a palace so splendid that her father 's seemed but a poor cottage in comparison with it , and when she recovered from her astonishment she found herself seated upon a couch , wrapped in a wonderful robe of satin fastened with a silken girdle , while beside her knelt a young man who whispered the sweetest speeches imaginable in her ear .

6 Hand in hand they wandered about the enchanted garden , and gathered the golden apples from the trees , and when they were tired of this amusement the princess led her friend through all the wonderful rooms of the palace , until at last they came to the one in which were kept all the marvellous dresses and ornaments the gnome had given to his hoped-for bride .
7 There they found so much to amuse them that the hours passed like minutes .
8 Veils , girdles , and necklaces were tried on and admired , the imitation Brunhilda knew so well how to behave herself , and showed so much taste that nobody would ever have suspected that she was nothing but a turnip after all .
9 The gnome , who had secretly been keeping an eye upon them , was very pleased with himself for having so well understood the heart of a woman ; and the princess seemed to him even more charming than before .
10 She did not forget to touch the rest of the roots with her magic wand , and soon had all her maidens about her , and even , as she had two tiny radishes to spare , her favourite cat , and her little dog whose name was Beni .
11 And now all went cheerfully in the castle .
12 The princess gave to each of the maidens her task , and never was mistress better served .
13 For a whole week she enjoyed the delight of her pleasant company undisturbed .
14 They all sang , they danced , they played from morning to night ; only the princess noticed that day by day the fresh young faces of her maidens grew pale and wan , and the mirror in the great marble hall showed her that she alone still kept her rosy bloom , while Brunhilda and the rest faded visibly .
15 They assured her that all was well with them ; but , nevertheless , they continued to waste away , and day by day it became harder to them to take part in the games of the princess , till at last , one fine morning , when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows , she shuddered and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones , with bent backs and trembling limbs , who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches , and coughed dismally .
16 A little nearer to the hearth lay the once frolicsome Beni , with all four feet stretched stiffly out , while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion .
17 The horrified princess fled to the door to escape from the sight of this mournful company , and called loudly for the gnome , who appeared at once , humbly anxious to do her bidding .
18 ` Malicious Sprite , ' she cried , ` why do you begrudge me my playmates -- the greatest delight of my lonely hours ?
19 Is n't this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your turning the castle into a hospital for the aged ?

8 They assured her that all was well with them ; but , nevertheless , they continued to waste away , and day by day it became harder to them to take part in the games of the princess , till at last , one fine morning , when the princess started from bed and hastened out to join her gay playfellows , she shuddered and started back at the sight of a group of shrivelled crones , with bent backs and trembling limbs , who supported their tottering steps with staves and crutches , and coughed dismally .
9 A little nearer to the hearth lay the once frolicsome Beni , with all four feet stretched stiffly out , while the sleek cat seemed too weak to raise his head from his velvet cushion .
10 The horrified princess fled to the door to escape from the sight of this mournful company , and called loudly for the gnome , who appeared at once , humbly anxious to do her bidding .
11 ` Malicious Sprite , ' she cried , ` why do you begrudge me my playmates -- the greatest delight of my lonely hours ?
12 Is n't this solitary life in such a desert bad enough without your turning the castle into a hospital for the aged ?
13 Give my maidens back their youth and health this very minute , or I will never love you ! '
14 ` Sweetest and fairest of damsels , ' cried the gnome , ` do not be angry ; everything that is in my power I will do -- but do not ask the impossible .
15 So long as the sap was fresh in the roots the magic staff could keep them in the forms you desired , but as the sap dried up they withered away .
16 But never trouble yourself about that , dearest one , a basket of fresh turnips will soon set matters right , and you can speedily call up again every form you wish to see .
17 The great green patch in the garden will prove you with a more lively company . '
18 So saying the gnome took himself off .
19 And the princess with her magic wand touched the wrinkled old women , and left them the withered roots they really were , to be thrown upon the rubbish heap ; and with light feet skipped off across to the meadow to take possession of the freshly filled basket .
20 But to her surprise she could not find it anywhere .
21 Up and down the XXXXX she searched , spying into every corner , but not a sign of it was to be found .	garden		Veils|basket|cat|games|garden|hearth|playmates|power|woman|women

4 Almost before the gnome had finished , the disappointed princess turned away , and marched off to her own apartments , without deigning to answer him .
5 The gnome , however , set off above ground as speedily as possible , and disguising himself as a farmer , bought an ass in the nearest market-town , and brought it back loaded with sacks of turnip , carrot , and radish seed .
6 With this he sowed a great field , and sent a vast army of his goblins to watch and tend it , and to bring up the fiery rivers from the heart of the earth near enough to warm and encourage the sprouting seeds .
7 Thus fostered they grew and flourished marvellously , and promised a goodly crop .
8 The princess wandered about the field day by day , no other plants or fruits in all her wonderful garden pleased her as much as these roots ; but still her eyes were full of discontent .
9 And , best of all , she loved to while away the hours in a shady fir-wood , seated upon the bank of a little stream , into which she would cast the flowers she had gathered and watch them float away .
10 The gnome tried hard by every means in his power to please the princess and win her love , but little did he guess the real reason of his lack of success .
11 He imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him ; but that was a mistake , for the truth was that another image already filled her heart .
12 The young Prince Ratibor , whose lands joined her father 's , had won the heart of the princess ; and the lovers had been looking forward to the coming of their wedding-day when the bride 's mysterious disappearance took place .
13 The sad news drove Ratibor distracted , and as the days went on , and nothing could be heard of the princess , he forsook his castle and the society of men , and spent his days in the wild forests , roaming about and crying her name aloud to the trees and rocks .
14 Meanwhile , the maiden , in her gorgeous prison , sighed in secret over her grief , not wishing to arouse the gnome 's suspicions .
15 In her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity , and at last she hit upon a plan .
16 By this time spring once more reigned in the valley , and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth , for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter hand now come to their full size .
