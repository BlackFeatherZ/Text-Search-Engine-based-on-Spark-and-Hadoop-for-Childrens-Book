15 I could only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up , hoping that when you grew up he might love you , and by your care be restored to his natural form .
16 And you see everything has come right , as I hoped it would .
17 Your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the power of the charm was nearly over , and my enemy 's last chance was to frighten you with her army of rats .
18 That she did not succeed in doing ; so now , my dear Felicia , if you will be married to my son with this silver ring your future happiness is certain .
19 Do you think him handsome and amiable enough to be willing to marry him ? ''
20 `` Madam , '' replied Felicia , blushing , `` you overwhelm me with your kindness .
21 I know that you are my mother 's sister , and that by your art you turned the soldiers who were sent to kill me into cabbages , and my nurse into a hen , and that you do me only too much honor in proposing that I shall marry your XXXXX .	son		aid|care|coat|knee|madam|shape|son|spite|velvet|way

1 She was interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a very handsome young man .
2 He wore a coat of green velvet fastened with emerald clasps , and had a crown of pinks on his head .
3 He knelt upon one knee and kissed the Queen 's hand .
4 `` Ah ! ''
5 she cried , `` my pink , my dear son , what a happiness to see you restored to your natural shape by Felicia 's aid ! ''
6 And she embraced him joyfully .
7 Then , turning to Felicia , she said : `` Charming Princess , I know all the hen told you , but you can not have heard that the zephyrs , to whom was entrusted the task of carrying my son to the tower where the Queen , your mother , so anxiously waited for him , left him instead in a garden of flowers , while they flew off to tell your mother .
8 Whereupon a fairy with whom I had quarrelled changed him into a pink , and I could do nothing to prevent it .
9 `` You can imagine how angry I was , and how I tried to find some means of undoing the mischief she had done ; but there was no help for it .
10 I could only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up , hoping that when you grew up he might love you , and by your care be restored to his natural form .
11 And you see everything has come right , as I hoped it would .

17 How can I explain to you the cause of my hesitation ?
18 I feel , for the first time in my life , how happy it would make me to be beloved .
19 Can you indeed give me the Prince 's heart ? ''
20 `` It is yours already , lovely Princess ! ''

7 This made the Princess very happy , and the Queen , who could not bear to see her dressed like a poor shepherdess , touched her with her wand , saying : `` I wish you to be attired as befits your rank and beauty . ''
8 And immediately the Princess 's cotton dress became a magnificent robe of silver brocade embroidered with carbuncles , and her soft dark hair was encircled by a crown of diamonds , from which floated a clear white veil .
9 With her bright eyes , and the charming color in her cheeks , she was altogether such a dazzling sight that the Prince could hardly bear it .
10 `` How pretty you are , Felicia ! ''
11 he cried .
12 `` Do n't keep me in suspense , I entreat you ; say that you will marry me . ''
13 `` Ah ! ''
14 said the Queen , smiling , `` I think she will not refuse now . ''
15 Just then Bruno , who was going back to his work , came out of the cottage , and thought he must be dreaming when he saw Felicia ; but she called him very kindly , and begged the Queen to take pity on him .
16 `` What ! ''
17 she said , `` when he was so unkind to you ? ''
18 `` Ah !
19 madam , '' said the Princess , `` I am so happy that I should like everybody else to be happy too . ''
20 The Queen kissed her , and said : `` Well , to please you , let me see what I can do for this cross Bruno . ''
21 And with a wave of her XXXXX she turned the poor little cottage into a splendid palace , full of treasures ; only the two stools and the straw bed remained just as they were , to remind him of his former poverty .	wand		cheeks|cross|enchantment|eyes|heart|pity|soldiers|son|wand|work

16 THE WHITE CAT Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons , who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead .
17 Now the King , though he felt that he was growing old , did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well , so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them .
18 So he sent for them all , and , after speaking to them kindly , he added : `` You will quite agree with me , my dear children , that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did .
19 I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects , therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown ; but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me .
20 Now , as I think of retiring into the country , it seems to me that a pretty , lively , faithful little dog would be very good company for me ; so , without any regard for your ages , I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once . ''

13 Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city , accompanied by all their particular friends , to whom they gave a grand banquet , and the three brothers promised to be friends always , to share whatever good fortune befell them , and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy ; and so they set out , agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time , to present themselves before the King together .

16 Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs -- big and little , greyhounds , mastiffs , spaniels , and lapdogs .
17 As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier , and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one , as , being alone , he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him .
18 He journeyed from day to day , not knowing where he was going , until at last , just at nightfall , he reached a great , gloomy forest .
19 He did not know his way , and , to make matters worse , it began to thunder , and the rain poured down .
20 He took the first path he could find , and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light , and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night .

5 THE WHITE CAT Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons , who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead .
6 Now the King , though he felt that he was growing old , did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well , so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them .
7 So he sent for them all , and , after speaking to them kindly , he added : `` You will quite agree with me , my dear children , that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did .
8 I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects , therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown ; but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me .
9 Now , as I think of retiring into the country , it seems to me that a pretty , lively , faithful little dog would be very good company for me ; so , without any regard for your ages , I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once . ''

16 There he saw a deer 's foot hanging by a chain of diamonds , and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle .
17 `` They must feel very secure against robbers , '' he said to himself .

20 He was so much surprised that he stood quite still , until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands , so that , though he was somewhat uneasy , he could not help going on .
21 With his hand on his sword , to be prepared for whatever might happen , he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli , while two lovely voices sang : `` The XXXXX you see floating above Will swiftly your bidding obey ; If your heart dreads not conquering Love , In this place you may fearlessly stay .

1 Now , as I think of retiring into the country , it seems to me that a pretty , lively , faithful little dog would be very good company for me ; so , without any regard for your ages , I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once . ''
2 The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father 's sudden fancy for a little dog , but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would not otherwise have had of being king , and as the eldest was too polite to make any objection , they accepted the commission with pleasure .

11 He took the first path he could find , and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light , and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night .

11 This door was of gold covered with carbuncles , and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest .
12 The walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors , and the Prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them ; but as he was terribly wet , and the rain still fell in torrents , he could not stay to look about any more , but came back to the golden door .
13 There he saw a deer 's foot hanging by a chain of diamonds , and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle .
14 `` They must feel very secure against robbers , '' he said to himself .
15 `` What is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles , and making himself rich for life ? ''
16 He pulled the deer 's foot , and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open , but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air , each holding a torch .
17 He was so much surprised that he stood quite still , until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands , so that , though he was somewhat uneasy , he could not help going on .
18 With his hand on his sword , to be prepared for whatever might happen , he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli , while two lovely voices sang : `` The hands you see floating above Will swiftly your bidding obey ; If your heart dreads not conquering Love , In this place you may fearlessly stay . ''
19 The Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way , so , guided by the mysterious hands , he went toward a door of coral , which opened of its own accord , and he found himself in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl , out of which opened a number of other rooms , glittering with thousands of lights , and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered .
20 After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped , and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner ; at the same moment the fire lighted itself , and the pretty , soft , clever hands took off the Prince 's wet , muddy clothes , and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs , all embroidered with gold and emeralds .
21 He could not help admiring everything he saw , and the deft XXXXX in which the hands waited on him , though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump .	way		castle|colors|dogs|emeralds|envy|forest|place|shelter|torrents|way

1 They bade farewell to the King , who gave them presents of silver and precious stones , and appointed to meet them at the same hour , in the same place , after a year had passed , to see the little dogs they had brought for him .
2 Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city , accompanied by all their particular friends , to whom they gave a grand banquet , and the three brothers promised to be friends always , to share whatever good fortune befell them , and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy ; and so they set out , agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time , to present themselves before the King together .
3 Each one took a different road , and the two eldest met with many adventures ; but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear .
4 He was young , and gay , and handsome , and knew everything that a prince ought to know ; and as for his courage , there was simply no end to it .
5 Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs -- big and little , greyhounds , mastiffs , spaniels , and lapdogs .
6 As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier , and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one , as , being alone , he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him .
7 He journeyed from day to day , not knowing where he was going , until at last , just at nightfall , he reached a great , gloomy forest .
8 He did not know his way , and , to make matters worse , it began to thunder , and the rain poured down .

6 `` They must feel very secure against robbers , '' he said to himself .
7 `` What is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles , and making himself rich for life ? ''
8 He pulled the deer 's foot , and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open , but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air , each holding a torch .
9 He was so much surprised that he stood quite still , until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands , so that , though he was somewhat uneasy , he could not help going on .
10 With his hand on his sword , to be prepared for whatever might happen , he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli , while two lovely voices sang : `` The hands you see floating above Will swiftly your bidding obey ; If your heart dreads not conquering Love , In this place you may fearlessly stay . ''
11 The Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way , so , guided by the mysterious hands , he went toward a door of coral , which opened of its own accord , and he found himself in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl , out of which opened a number of other rooms , glittering with thousands of lights , and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered .
12 After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped , and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner ; at the same moment the fire lighted itself , and the pretty , soft , clever hands took off the Prince 's wet , muddy clothes , and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs , all embroidered with gold and emeralds .
13 He could not help admiring everything he saw , and the deft way in which the hands waited on him , though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump .
14 When he was quite ready -- and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain , and pulled the deer 's foot -- the hands led him to a splendid room , upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats .
15 The table was laid for supper with two golden plates , and golden spoons and forks , and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones .
16 The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for , when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music , who took their places at one end of the room , and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key , and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars , making the strangest kind of music that could be heard .
17 The Prince hastily stopped up his ears , but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter .
18 `` What funny thing shall I see next ? ''
19 he said to himself , and instantly the door opened , and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil .
20 It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords , and a large party of cats followed , who brought in cages full of rats and mice .
21 The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming , but the little XXXXX came up to him and threw back its veil , and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine .	figure		clothes|dishes|figure|forest|hall|length|moment|robbers|stories|voices

1 He took the first path he could find , and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light , and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night .
2 At length , guided by the light , he reached the door of the most splendid castle he could have imagined .
3 This door was of gold covered with carbuncles , and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest .
4 The walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors , and the Prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them ; but as he was terribly wet , and the rain still fell in torrents , he could not stay to look about any more , but came back to the golden door .

6 After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped , and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner ; at the same moment the fire lighted itself , and the pretty , soft , clever hands took off the Prince 's wet , muddy clothes , and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs , all embroidered with gold and emeralds .
7 He could not help admiring everything he saw , and the deft way in which the hands waited on him , though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump .
8 When he was quite ready -- and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain , and pulled the deer 's foot -- the hands led him to a splendid room , upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats .
9 The table was laid for supper with two golden plates , and golden spoons and forks , and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones .
10 The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for , when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music , who took their places at one end of the room , and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key , and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars , making the strangest kind of music that could be heard .
11 The Prince hastily stopped up his ears , but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter .
12 `` What funny thing shall I see next ? ''
13 he said to himself , and instantly the door opened , and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil .
14 It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords , and a large party of cats followed , who brought in cages full of rats and mice .
15 The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming , but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil , and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine .
16 She looked very young and very sad , and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince : `` King 's son , you are welcome ; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you . ''
17 `` Lady Cat , '' replied the Prince , `` I thank you for receiving me so kindly , but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat ?
18 Indeed , the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly . ''
19 `` King 's son , '' said the White Cat , `` I beg you to spare me these compliments , for I am not used to them .
20 But now , '' she added , `` let supper be served , and let the musicians be silent , as the Prince does not understand what they are saying . ''
21 So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper , and first they put on the XXXXX two dishes , one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice .	table		anyone|door|everything|heart|moment|plates|rain|sight|table|voice

2 He pulled the deer 's foot , and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open , but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air , each holding a torch .
3 He was so much surprised that he stood quite still , until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands , so that , though he was somewhat uneasy , he could not help going on .
4 With his hand on his sword , to be prepared for whatever might happen , he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli , while two lovely voices sang : `` The hands you see floating above Will swiftly your bidding obey ; If your heart dreads not conquering Love , In this place you may fearlessly stay .

1 After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped , and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner ; at the same moment the fire lighted itself , and the pretty , soft , clever hands took off the Prince 's wet , muddy clothes , and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs , all embroidered with gold and emeralds .
2 He could not help admiring everything he saw , and the deft way in which the hands waited on him , though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump .
3 When he was quite ready -- and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain , and pulled the deer 's foot -- the hands led him to a splendid room , upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats .
4 The table was laid for supper with two golden plates , and golden spoons and forks , and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones .
5 The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for , when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music , who took their places at one end of the room , and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key , and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars , making the strangest kind of music that could be heard .
6 The Prince hastily stopped up his ears , but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter .
7 `` What funny thing shall I see next ? ''
8 he said to himself , and instantly the door opened , and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil .
9 It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords , and a large party of cats followed , who brought in cages full of rats and mice .
10 The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming , but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil , and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine .
11 She looked very young and very sad , and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince : `` King 's son , you are welcome ; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you . ''
12 `` Lady Cat , '' replied the Prince , `` I thank you for receiving me so kindly , but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat ?
13 Indeed , the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly . ''
14 `` King 's son , '' said the White Cat , `` I beg you to spare me these compliments , for I am not used to them .
15 But now , '' she added , `` let supper be served , and let the musicians be silent , as the Prince does not understand what they are saying . ''
16 So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper , and first they put on the table two dishes , one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice .
17 The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all ; but the White Cat , seeing this , assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen , and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice ; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning .
18 Presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait , and he begged to be allowed to look at it .
19 To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man , who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait !
20 The White Cat sighed as he looked at it , and seemed sadder than ever , and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her ; so he began to talk about other things , and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself , and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world .
21 After supper they went into another XXXXX , which was fitted up as a theatre , and the cats acted and danced for their amusement , and then the White Cat said good-night to him , and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before , hung with tapestry worked with butterflies ' wings of every color ; there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor , and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons .	room		clothes|pigeons|portrait|rain|room|rooms|sideboard|sight|supper|way

16 The White Cat herself was riding a monkey , which climbed even up to the eagles ' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets .
17 Never was there a pleasanter hunting party , and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before , but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet , which must have contained a magic draught , for , as soon as he had swallowed its contents , he forgot everything , even the little dog that he was seeking for the King , and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat !
18 And so the days passed , in every kind of amusement , until the year was nearly gone .
19 The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers : he did not even know what country he belonged to ; but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back , and one day she said to him : `` Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father , and your brothers have found lovely ones ? ''
20 Then the Prince suddenly recovered his memory , and cried : `` What can have made me forget such an important thing ?
21 My whole fortune depends upon it ; and even if I could in such a short time find a XXXXX pretty enough to gain me a kingdom , where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days ? ''	dog		castle|country|courtyard|dishes|dog|hands|hunting|rats|room|son

15 The hands led a wooden horse up to the Prince , and seemed to expect him to mount it , at which he was very indignant ; but it was no use for him to object , for he speedily found himself upon its back , and it pranced gaily off with him .
16 The White Cat herself was riding a monkey , which climbed even up to the eagles ' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets .
17 Never was there a pleasanter hunting party , and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before , but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet , which must have contained a magic draught , for , as soon as he had swallowed its contents , he forgot everything , even the little dog that he was seeking for the King , and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat !
18 And so the days passed , in every kind of amusement , until the year was nearly gone .
19 The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers : he did not even know what country he belonged to ; but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back , and one day she said to him : `` Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father , and your brothers have found lovely ones ? ''
20 Then the Prince suddenly recovered his memory , and cried : `` What can have made me forget such an important thing ?
21 My whole fortune depends upon it ; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom , where should I find a XXXXX who would carry me all that way in three days ? ''	horse		amusement|heart|horse|magnificence|memory|pigeons|portrait|supper|theatre|voice

1 The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming , but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil , and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine .
2 She looked very young and very sad , and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince : `` King 's son , you are welcome ; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you . ''
3 `` Lady Cat , '' replied the Prince , `` I thank you for receiving me so kindly , but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat ?
4 Indeed , the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly . ''
5 `` King 's son , '' said the White Cat , `` I beg you to spare me these compliments , for I am not used to them .
6 But now , '' she added , `` let supper be served , and let the musicians be silent , as the Prince does not understand what they are saying . ''
7 So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper , and first they put on the table two dishes , one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice .
8 The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all ; but the White Cat , seeing this , assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen , and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice ; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning .
9 Presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait , and he begged to be allowed to look at it .
10 To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man , who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait !
11 The White Cat sighed as he looked at it , and seemed sadder than ever , and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her ; so he began to talk about other things , and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself , and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world .
12 After supper they went into another room , which was fitted up as a theatre , and the cats acted and danced for their amusement , and then the White Cat said good-night to him , and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before , hung with tapestry worked with butterflies ' wings of every color ; there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor , and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons .
13 The Prince went to bed in silence , as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with the hands that waited on him , and in the morning he was awakened by a noise and confusion outside of his window , and the hands came and quickly dressed him in hunting costume .

20 He wanted to take it out and look at it , but the White Cat said it would be better not to open the acorn till he was before the King , in case the tiny dog should be cold on the journey .
21 He thanked her a thousand times , and said good-by quite sadly when the XXXXX came for him to set out .	time		case|courtyard|ear|horns|horse|journey|kingdom|time|voice|way

1 The White Cat herself was riding a monkey , which climbed even up to the eagles ' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets .
2 Never was there a pleasanter hunting party , and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before , but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet , which must have contained a magic draught , for , as soon as he had swallowed its contents , he forgot everything , even the little dog that he was seeking for the King , and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat !
3 And so the days passed , in every kind of amusement , until the year was nearly gone .
4 The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers : he did not even know what country he belonged to ; but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back , and one day she said to him : `` Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father , and your brothers have found lovely ones ? ''
5 Then the Prince suddenly recovered his memory , and cried : `` What can have made me forget such an important thing ?
6 My whole fortune depends upon it ; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom , where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days ? ''
7 And he began to be very vexed .
8 But the White Cat said to him : `` King 's son , do not trouble yourself ; I am your friend , and will make everything easy for you .
9 You can still stay here for a day , as the good wooden horse can take you to your country in twelve hours . ''
10 `` I thank you , beautiful Cat , '' said the Prince ; `` but what good will it do me to get back if I have not a dog to take to my father ? ''
11 `` See here , '' answered the White Cat , holding up an acorn ; `` there is a prettier one in this than in the Dogstar ! ''

1 The next morning they started in the same chariot .
2 The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny , fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them .
3 As for the turnspit , he ran after the chariot , and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all .
4 When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King 's great hall ; and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier .
5 They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally , when the youngest stepped forward , drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him .
6 He opened it quickly , and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring .
7 The Prince laid it upon the ground , and it got up at once and began to dance .
8 The King did not know what to say , for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature .
9 Nevertheless , as he was in no hurry to part with his crown , he told his sons that , as they had been so successful the first time , he would ask them to go once again , and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle .
10 The brothers were not very willing to set out again , but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance , and they started as before .
11 The youngest again mounted the wooden horse , and rode back at full speed to his beloved White Cat .
12 Every door of the castle stood wide open , and every window and turret was illuminated , so it looked more wonderful than before .
13 The hands hastened to meet him , and led the wooden horse off to the stable , while he hurried in to find the White Cat .
14 She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion , but she very soon started up when she heard the Prince , and was overjoyed at seeing him once more .

19 And then the hands appeared carrying torches , and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river , from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts ; after which they had supper , which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks , for it was very late , and he was hungry after his long ride .
20 And so the days passed quickly as before ; it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat , and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements -- indeed , she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be .

19 And indeed the stuff was very fine , and would go through the eye of a very large needle ; but the King , who was only too glad to make a difficulty , sent for a particular needle , which was kept among the Crown jewels , and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it .
20 The Princes were angry , and were beginning to complain that it was a trick , when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest Prince came in .
21 His father and XXXXX were quite astonished at his magnificence , and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it , fully expecting to find the piece of muslin , but instead there was only a hazel-nut .	brothers		Lovely|abreast|amusements|brothers|courtyard|heart|kindness|palace|paw|task

1 The White Cat looked serious , and said she must think what was to be done , but that , luckily , there were some cats in the castle who could spin very well , and if anybody could manage it they could , and she would set them the task herself .
2 And then the hands appeared carrying torches , and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river , from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts ; after which they had supper , which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks , for it was very late , and he was hungry after his long ride .
3 And so the days passed quickly as before ; it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat , and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements -- indeed , she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be .
4 But when the Prince asked her how it was that she was so wise , she only said : `` King 's son , do not ask me ; guess what you please .
5 I may not tell you anything . ''
6 The Prince was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the time , but presently the White Cat told him that the year was gone , and that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin , as they had made it very well .
7 `` This time , '' she added , `` I can give you a suitable escort '' ; and on looking out into the courtyard the Prince saw a superb chariot of burnished gold , enameled in flame color with a thousand different devices .
8 It was drawn by twelve snow-white horses , harnessed four abreast ; their trappings were flame-colored velvet , embroidered with diamonds .
9 A hundred chariots followed , each drawn by eight horses , and filled with officers in splendid uniforms , and a thousand guards surrounded the procession .
10 `` Go ! ''
11 said the White Cat , `` and when you appear before the King in such state he surely will not refuse you the crown which you deserve .
12 Take this walnut , but do not open it until you are before him , then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me for . ''
13 `` Lovely Blanchette , '' said the Prince , `` how can I thank you properly for all your kindness to me ?
14 Only tell me that you wish it , and I will give up for ever all thought of being king , and will stay here with you always . ''
15 `` King 's son , '' she replied , `` it shows the goodness of your heart that you should care so much for a little white cat , who is good for nothing but to catch mice ; but you must not stay . ''
16 So the Prince kissed her little paw and set out .

8 Nobody had ever been into it , but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things , and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else .
9 She began to wish to try them for herself , and turned her steps in the direction of the garden .
10 On arriving at the door , which blazed with gold and jewels , she ordered her servants to knock loudly , but it was useless ; it seemed as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead .
11 Now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit , the more the Queen was determined that have it she would .
12 So she ordered that they should bring ladders , and get over the wall into the garden ; but though the wall did not look very high , and they tied the ladders together to make them very long , it was quite impossible to get to the top .
13 `` The Queen was in despair , but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were , and went to bed herself , feeling quite ill , she was so disappointed .

18 ` No , ' replied the old fairy , ` we will have nothing but your little daughter .

20 ` Though it is a hard condition , ' said the Queen , ' I consent , for I shall certainly die if I do not taste the fruit , and so I should lose my little daughter either way . '
21 `` So the old fairy led her into the castle , and , though it was still the middle of the night , the Queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told , which you can easily believe , Prince , '' said the White Cat , `` when I tell you that it was this XXXXX that we are now in .	castle		amazement|castle|cat|direction|door|fruits|hand|jewels|middle|tales

15 The old fairy whistled twice , then she cried : '' ` Apricots , peaches , nectarines , cherries , plums , pears , melons , grapes , apples , oranges , lemons , gooseberries , strawberries , raspberries , come ! '
16 `` And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another , and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt , and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them .
17 You see they grew upon fairy trees .
18 `` The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away , and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry .
19 Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement , and led her back to the camp , and next morning she went back to her kingdom , but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain , and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened , and asked what was the matter .
20 At first the Queen was afraid to tell him , but when , as soon as they reached the palace , five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me , she was obliged to confess what she had promised .
21 The King was very angry , and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded , and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom ; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met , and whose breath burnt up XXXXX as he passed through the country ; and at last , after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster , the King , to save his subjects , was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies .	everything		castle|daughter|despair|everything|fairy-land|grapes|lemons|matter|nothing|way

1 Now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit , the more the Queen was determined that have it she would .
2 So she ordered that they should bring ladders , and get over the wall into the garden ; but though the wall did not look very high , and they tied the ladders together to make them very long , it was quite impossible to get to the top .
3 `` The Queen was in despair , but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were , and went to bed herself , feeling quite ill , she was so disappointed .
4 In the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened , and saw to her surprise a tiny , ugly old woman seated by her bedside , who said to her : '' ' I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit ; but to save you annoyance , my sisters and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away , on one condition -- that is , that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own . ' ''
5 ` Ah !

7 I will give you my kingdoms willingly . ' ''
8 ` No , ' replied the old fairy , ` we will have nothing but your little daughter .
9 She shall be as happy as the day is long , and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairy-land , but you must not see her again until she is married . ' ''
10 ` Though it is a hard condition , ' said the Queen , ' I consent , for I shall certainly die if I do not taste the fruit , and so I should lose my little daughter either way . '
11 `` So the old fairy led her into the castle , and , though it was still the middle of the night , the Queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told , which you can easily believe , Prince , '' said the White Cat , `` when I tell you that it was this castle that we are now in .
12 ` Will you gather the fruit yourself , Queen ? '
13 said the old fairy , ` or shall I call it to come to you ? ' '' '
14 I beg you to let me see it come when it is called , ' cried the Queen ; ` that will be something quite new . '

8 I beg you to let me see it come when it is called , ' cried the Queen ; ` that will be something quite new . '

10 `` And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another , and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt , and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them .
11 You see they grew upon fairy trees .
12 `` The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away , and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry .
13 Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement , and led her back to the camp , and next morning she went back to her kingdom , but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain , and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened , and asked what was the matter .
14 At first the Queen was afraid to tell him , but when , as soon as they reached the palace , five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me , she was obliged to confess what she had promised .
15 The King was very angry , and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded , and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom ; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met , and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country ; and at last , after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster , the King , to save his subjects , was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies .
16 This time they came themselves to fetch me , in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses , followed by the dragon , who was led with chains of diamonds .
17 My cradle was placed between the old fairies , who loaded me with caresses , and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me .
18 There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare , and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess , but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog , who could both talk ; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies , who came mounted upon the dragon .
19 One day , however , as I sat at my window I saw a handsome young prince , who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison , and who was standing and looking up at me .
20 When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference .

2 I beg you to let me see it come when it is called , ' cried the Queen ; ` that will be something quite new . '
3 The old fairy whistled twice , then she cried : '' ` Apricots , peaches , nectarines , cherries , plums , pears , melons , grapes , apples , oranges , lemons , gooseberries , strawberries , raspberries , come ! '
4 `` And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another , and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt , and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them .
5 You see they grew upon fairy trees .
6 `` The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away , and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry .
7 Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement , and led her back to the camp , and next morning she went back to her kingdom , but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain , and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened , and asked what was the matter .
8 At first the Queen was afraid to tell him , but when , as soon as they reached the palace , five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me , she was obliged to confess what she had promised .
9 The King was very angry , and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded , and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom ; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met , and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country ; and at last , after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster , the King , to save his subjects , was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies .
10 This time they came themselves to fetch me , in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses , followed by the dragon , who was led with chains of diamonds .
11 My cradle was placed between the old fairies , who loaded me with caresses , and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me .
12 There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare , and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess , but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog , who could both talk ; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies , who came mounted upon the dragon .
13 One day , however , as I sat at my window I saw a handsome young prince , who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison , and who was standing and looking up at me .
14 When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference .
15 You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to , and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell , then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell .
16 But after that he came again many times and at last I consented to marry him , but the question was how was I to escape from my tower .
17 The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning , and by great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower ; but , alas !
18 just as my prince was helping me to descend it , the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in .
19 Before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon .
20 As for me , the fairies , furious at having their plans defeated , for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs , and I utterly refused , changed me into a white cat .

1 My cradle was placed between the old fairies , who loaded me with caresses , and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me .
2 There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare , and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess , but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog , who could both talk ; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies , who came mounted upon the dragon .
3 One day , however , as I sat at my window I saw a handsome young prince , who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison , and who was standing and looking up at me .
4 When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference .
5 You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to , and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell , then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell .

10 THE WATER-LILY .

14 The old woman kept the girls hard at work , from morning till night , spinning gold flax into yarn , and when one distaff was empty another was given them , so they had no rest .
15 The thread had to be fine and even , and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman , who twice or thrice every summer went a journey .
16 Before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence , and always returned in the night , so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her , neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came , nor what it was to be used for .
17 Now , when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys , she gave each maiden work for six days , with the usual warning : `` Children , do n't let your eyes wander , and on no account speak to a man , for , if you do , your thread will lose its brightness , and misfortunes of all kinds will follow .

10 Now , when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys , she gave each maiden work for six days , with the usual warning : `` Children , do n't let your eyes wander , and on no account speak to a man , for , if you do , your thread will lose its brightness , and misfortunes of all kinds will follow .

13 Weary of seeking his way , he flung himself down under a tree , leaving his horse to browse at will , and fell asleep .
14 The sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest .

16 The maidens , who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness , saw him approaching , and the two elder were much alarmed , for they remembered the old woman 's warning ; but the youngest said : `` Never before have I seen anyone like him ; let me have one look . ''
17 They entreated her to come in , but , seeing that she would not , left her , and the Prince , coming up , courteously greeted the maiden , and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary .
18 She set food before him , and was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old woman 's caution , and lingered for hours .
19 In the meantime the Prince 's companions sought him far and wide , but to no purpose , so they sent two messengers to tell the sad news to the King , who immediately ordered a regiment of cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him .
20 After three days ' search , they found the hut .

2 The thread had to be fine and even , and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman , who twice or thrice every summer went a journey .
3 Before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence , and always returned in the night , so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her , neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came , nor what it was to be used for .
4 Now , when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys , she gave each maiden work for six days , with the usual warning : `` Children , do n't let your eyes wander , and on no account speak to a man , for , if you do , your thread will lose its brightness , and misfortunes of all kinds will follow . ''
5 They laughed at this oft-repeated caution , saying to each other : `` How can our gold thread lose its brightness , and have we any chance of speaking to a man ? ''
6 On the third day after the old woman 's departure a young prince , hunting in the forest , got separated from his companions , and completely lost .
7 Weary of seeking his way , he flung himself down under a tree , leaving his horse to browse at will , and fell asleep .
8 The sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest .
9 At last he perceived a narrow foot-path , which he eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut .
10 The maidens , who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness , saw him approaching , and the two elder were much alarmed , for they remembered the old woman 's warning ; but the youngest said : `` Never before have I seen anyone like him ; let me have one look . ''
11 They entreated her to come in , but , seeing that she would not , left her , and the Prince , coming up , courteously greeted the maiden , and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary .
12 She set food before him , and was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old woman 's caution , and lingered for hours .
13 In the meantime the Prince 's companions sought him far and wide , but to no purpose , so they sent two messengers to tell the sad news to the King , who immediately ordered a regiment of cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him .
14 After three days ' search , they found the hut .
15 The Prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maiden 's company that the time had seemed like a single hour .
16 Before leaving he promised to return and fetch her to his father 's court , where he would make her his bride .
17 When he had gone , she sat down to her wheel to make up for lost time , but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all its brightness .
18 Her heart beat fast and she wept bitterly , for she remembered the old woman 's warning and knew not what misfortune might now befall her .
19 The old woman returned in the night and knew by the tarnished thread what had happened in her absence .
20 She was furiously angry and told the maiden that she had brought down misery both on herself and on the Prince .
21 The XXXXX could not rest for thinking of this .	maiden		caution|chamber|father|girls|maiden|messengers|misfortune|purpose|sun|woman

17 When he saw the maiden he sprang from his horse , lifted her into the saddle , and then , mounting behind , rode homeward .
18 The moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees .
19 By and by the coming of dawn loosened the tongues of all the birds , and , had the Prince only known what they were saying , or the maiden been listening , they might have been spared much sorrow , but they were thinking only of each other , and when they came out of the forest the sun was high in the heavens .
