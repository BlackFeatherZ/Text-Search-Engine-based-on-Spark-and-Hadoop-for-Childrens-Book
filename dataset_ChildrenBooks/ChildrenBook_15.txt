16 But no one appeared , and even after another long sleep , from which he awoke completely refreshed , there was no sign of anybody , though a fresh meal of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared upon the little table at his elbow .

2 Her father still tried to persuade her to go back , but in vain .
3 While they were talking the night fell , and then , to their great surprise , wonderful colored lights began to shine in all directions , and splendid fireworks blazed out before them ; all the forest was illuminated by them , and even felt pleasantly warm , though it had been bitterly cold before .
4 This lasted until they reached the avenue of orange trees , where were statues holding flaming torches , and when they got nearer to the palace they saw that it was illuminated from the roof to the ground , and music sounded softly from the courtyard .
5 `` The Beast must be very hungry , '' said Beauty , trying to laugh , `` if he makes all this rejoicing over the arrival of his prey . ''
6 But , in spite of her anxiety , she could not help admiring all the wonderful things she saw .
7 The horse stopped at the foot of the flight of steps leading to the terrace , and when they had dismounted her father led her to the little room he had been in before , where they found a splendid fire burning , and the table daintily spread with a delicious supper .
8 The merchant knew that this was meant for them , and Beauty , who was rather less frightened now that she had passed through so many rooms and seen nothing of the Beast , was quite willing to begin , for her long ride had made her very hungry .
9 But they had hardly finished their meal when the noise of the Beast 's footsteps was heard approaching , and Beauty clung to her father in terror , which became all the greater when she saw how frightened he was .
10 But when the Beast really appeared , though she trembled at the sight of him , she made a great effort to hide her terror , and saluted him respectfully .
11 This evidently pleased the Beast .
12 After looking at her he said , in a tone that might have struck terror into the boldest heart , though he did not seem to be angry : `` Good-evening , old man .

2 But , after all , it was only a dream , so why should I trouble myself about it ?
3 I had better go and find something to do to amuse myself . ''
4 So she got up and began to explore some of the many rooms of the palace .
5 The first she entered was lined with mirrors , and Beauty saw herself reflected on every side , and thought she had never seen such a charming room .
6 Then a bracelet which was hanging from a chandelier caught her eye , and on taking it down she was greatly surprised to find that it held a portrait of her unknown admirer , just as she had seen him in her dream .
7 With great delight she slipped the bracelet on her arm , and went on into a gallery of pictures , where she soon found a portrait of the same handsome Prince , as large as life , and so well painted that as she studied it he seemed to smile kindly at her .
8 Tearing herself away from the portrait at last , she passed through into a room which contained every musical instrument under the sun , and here she amused herself for a long while in trying some of them , and singing until she was tired .
9 The next room was a library , and she saw everything she had ever wanted to read , as well as everything she had read , and it seemed to her that a whole lifetime would not be enough to even read the names of the books , there were so many .
10 By this time it was growing dusk , and wax candles in diamond and ruby candlesticks were beginning to light themselves in every room .
11 Beauty found her supper served just at the time she preferred to have it , but she did not see anyone or hear a sound , and , though her father had warned her that she would be alone , she began to find it rather dull .
12 But presently she heard the Beast coming , and wondered tremblingly if he meant to eat her up now .
13 However , as he did not seem at all ferocious , and only said gruffly : `` Good-evening , Beauty , '' she answered cheerfully and managed to conceal her terror .
14 Then the Beast asked her how she had been amusing herself , and she told him all the rooms she had seen .
15 Then he asked if she thought she could be happy in his palace ; and Beauty answered that everything was so beautiful that she would be very hard to please if she could not be happy .
16 And after about an hour 's talk Beauty began to think that the Beast was not nearly so terrible as she had supposed at first .

8 And then her dreams changed , but the charming Prince figured in them all ; and when morning came her first thought was to look at the portrait , and see if it was really like him , and she found that it certainly was .

10 When she was tired she went back to the palace , and found a new room full of materials for every kind of work -- ribbons to make into bows , and silks to work into flowers .
11 Then there was an aviary full of rare birds , which were so tame that they flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her , and perched upon her shoulders and her head .
12 `` Pretty little creatures , '' she said , `` how I wish that your cage was nearer to my room , that I might often hear you sing ! ''
13 So saying she opened a door , and found , to her delight , that it led into her own room , though she had thought it was quite the other side of the palace .
14 There were more birds in a room farther on , parrots and cockatoos that could talk , and they greeted Beauty by name ; indeed , she found them so entertaining that she took one or two back to her room , and they talked to her while she was at supper ; after which the Beast paid her his usual visit , and asked her the same questions as before , and then with a gruff `` good-night '' he took his departure , and Beauty went to bed to dream of her mysterious Prince .

16 There was one room which she had not noticed particularly ; it was empty , except that under each of the windows stood a very comfortable chair ; and the first time she had looked out of the window it had seemed to her that a black curtain prevented her from seeing anything outside .
17 But the second time she went into the room , happening to be tired , she sat down in one of the chairs , when instantly the curtain was rolled aside , and a most amusing pantomime was acted before her ; there were dances , and colored lights , and music , and pretty dresses , and it was all so gay that Beauty was in ecstacies .

8 The days passed swiftly in different amusements , and after a while Beauty found out another strange thing in the palace , which often pleased her when she was tired of being alone .
9 There was one room which she had not noticed particularly ; it was empty , except that under each of the windows stood a very comfortable chair ; and the first time she had looked out of the window it had seemed to her that a black curtain prevented her from seeing anything outside .
10 But the second time she went into the room , happening to be tired , she sat down in one of the chairs , when instantly the curtain was rolled aside , and a most amusing pantomime was acted before her ; there were dances , and colored lights , and music , and pretty dresses , and it was all so gay that Beauty was in ecstacies .
11 After that she tried the other seven windows in turn , and there was some new and surprising entertainment to be seen from each of them , so that Beauty never could feel lonely any more .
12 Every evening after supper the Beast came to see her , and always before saying good-night asked her in his terrible voice : `` Beauty , will you marry me ? ''
13 And it seemed to Beauty , now she understood him better , that when she said , `` No , Beast , '' he went away quite sad .
14 But her happy dreams of the handsome young Prince soon made her forget the poor Beast , and the only thing that at all disturbed her was to be constantly told to distrust appearances , to let her heart guide her , and not her eyes , and many other equally perplexing things , which , consider as she would , she could not understand .
15 So everything went on for a long time , until at last , happy as she was , Beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and sisters ; and one night , seeing her look very sad , the Beast asked her what was the matter .
16 Beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him .
17 Now she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful voice .
18 So she answered that she was longing to see her home once more .
19 Upon hearing this the Beast seemed sadly distressed , and cried miserably .

1 And then her dreams changed , but the charming Prince figured in them all ; and when morning came her first thought was to look at the portrait , and see if it was really like him , and she found that it certainly was .
2 This morning she decided to amuse herself in the garden , for the sun shone , and all the fountains were playing ; but she was astonished to find that every place was familiar to her , and presently she came to the brook where the myrtle trees were growing where she had first met the Prince in her dream , and that made her think more than ever that he must be kept a prisoner by the Beast .
3 When she was tired she went back to the palace , and found a new room full of materials for every kind of work -- ribbons to make into bows , and silks to work into flowers .
4 Then there was an aviary full of rare birds , which were so tame that they flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her , and perched upon her shoulders and her head .
5 `` Pretty little creatures , '' she said , `` how I wish that your cage was nearer to my room , that I might often hear you sing ! ''

18 `` No , dear Beast , '' answered Beauty softly , `` I do not hate you , and I should be very sorry never to see you any more , but I long to see my father again .

1 The days passed swiftly in different amusements , and after a while Beauty found out another strange thing in the palace , which often pleased her when she was tired of being alone .
2 There was one room which she had not noticed particularly ; it was empty , except that under each of the windows stood a very comfortable chair ; and the first time she had looked out of the window it had seemed to her that a black curtain prevented her from seeing anything outside .
3 But the second time she went into the room , happening to be tired , she sat down in one of the chairs , when instantly the curtain was rolled aside , and a most amusing pantomime was acted before her ; there were dances , and colored lights , and music , and pretty dresses , and it was all so gay that Beauty was in ecstacies .
4 After that she tried the other seven windows in turn , and there was some new and surprising entertainment to be seen from each of them , so that Beauty never could feel lonely any more .
5 Every evening after supper the Beast came to see her , and always before saying good-night asked her in his terrible voice : `` Beauty , will you marry me ? ''
6 And it seemed to Beauty , now she understood him better , that when she said , `` No , Beast , '' he went away quite sad .
7 But her happy dreams of the handsome young Prince soon made her forget the poor Beast , and the only thing that at all disturbed her was to be constantly told to distrust appearances , to let her heart guide her , and not her eyes , and many other equally perplexing things , which , consider as she would , she could not understand .
8 So everything went on for a long time , until at last , happy as she was , Beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and sisters ; and one night , seeing her look very sad , the Beast asked her what was the matter .
9 Beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him .
10 Now she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his dreadful voice .
11 So she answered that she was longing to see her home once more .
12 Upon hearing this the Beast seemed sadly distressed , and cried miserably .
13 `` Ah !
14 Beauty , have you the heart to desert an unhappy Beast like this ?
15 What more do you want to make you happy ?
16 Is it because you hate me that you want to escape ? ''
17 `` No , dear Beast , '' answered Beauty softly , `` I do not hate you , and I should be very sorry never to see you any more , but I long to see my father again .
18 Only let me go for two months , and I promise to come back to you and stay for the rest of my life . ''
19 The Beast , who had been sighing dolefully while she spoke , now replied : `` I can not refuse you anything you ask , even though it should cost me my life .
20 Take the four boxes you will find in the room next to your own , and fill them with everything you wish to take with you .

1 said the Prince `` Surely you would not care ? ''
2 `` Indeed , I should be ungrateful if I did not care for such a kind Beast , '' cried Beauty indignantly .
3 `` I would die to save him from pain .
4 I assure you it is not his fault that he is so ugly . ''
5 Just then a strange sound woke her -- someone was speaking not very far away ; and opening her eyes she found herself in a room she had never seen before , which was certainly not nearly so splendid as those she was used to in the Beast 's palace .
6 Where could she be ?
7 She got up and dressed hastily , and then saw that the boxes she had packed the night before were all in the room .
8 While she was wondering by what magic the Beast had transported them and herself to this strange place she suddenly heard her father 's voice , and rushed out and greeted him joyfully .
9 Her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance , as they had never expected to see her again , and there was no end to the questions they asked her .
10 She had also much to hear about what had happened to them while she was away , and of her father 's journey home .
11 But when they heard that she had only come to be with them for a short time , and then must go back to the Beast 's palace for ever , they lamented loudly .
12 Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams , and why the Prince constantly begged her not to trust to appearances .
13 After much consideration , he answered : `` You tell me yourself that the Beast , frightful as he is , loves you dearly , and deserves your love and gratitude for his gentleness and kindness ; I think the Prince must mean you to understand that you ought to reward him by doing as he wishes you to , in spite of his ugliness . ''
14 Beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable ; still , when she thought of her dear Prince who was so handsome , she did not feel at all inclined to marry the Beast .

19 She thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens , when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave , and running quickly to see what could be the matter , she found the Beast stretched out upon his side , apparently dying .
20 He reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress , and at the same moment a stately lady appeared , and said very gravely : `` Ah !

1 Just then a strange sound woke her -- someone was speaking not very far away ; and opening her eyes she found herself in a room she had never seen before , which was certainly not nearly so splendid as those she was used to in the Beast 's palace .
2 Where could she be ?
3 She got up and dressed hastily , and then saw that the boxes she had packed the night before were all in the room .
4 While she was wondering by what magic the Beast had transported them and herself to this strange place she suddenly heard her father 's voice , and rushed out and greeted him joyfully .
5 Her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance , as they had never expected to see her again , and there was no end to the questions they asked her .
6 She had also much to hear about what had happened to them while she was away , and of her father 's journey home .
7 But when they heard that she had only come to be with them for a short time , and then must go back to the Beast 's palace for ever , they lamented loudly .
8 Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams , and why the Prince constantly begged her not to trust to appearances .
9 After much consideration , he answered : `` You tell me yourself that the Beast , frightful as he is , loves you dearly , and deserves your love and gratitude for his gentleness and kindness ; I think the Prince must mean you to understand that you ought to reward him by doing as he wishes you to , in spite of his ugliness . ''
10 Beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable ; still , when she thought of her dear Prince who was so handsome , she did not feel at all inclined to marry the Beast .
11 At any rate , for two months she need not decide , but could enjoy herself with her sisters .
12 But though they were rich now , and lived in town again , and had plenty of acquaintances , Beauty found that nothing amused her very much ; and she often thought of the palace , where she was so happy , especially as at home she never once dreamed of her dear Prince , and she felt quite sad without him .
13 Then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her , and even found her rather in the way , so she would not have been sorry when the two months were over but for her father and brothers , who begged her to stay , and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure that she had not the courage to say good-by to them .
14 Every day when she got up she meant to say it at night , and when night came she put it off again , until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her mind .
15 She thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens , when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave , and running quickly to see what could be the matter , she found the Beast stretched out upon his side , apparently dying .
16 He reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress , and at the same moment a stately lady appeared , and said very gravely : `` Ah !
17 Beauty , you are only just in time to save his life .
18 See what happens when people do not keep their promises !
19 If you had delayed one day more , you would have found him dead . ''
