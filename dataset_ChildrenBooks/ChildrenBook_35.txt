15 The girl had been born in the town , and had scarcely ever left it ; but the young man was a native of another country , and had only come to the city near the great river because he could find no work to do where he was .
16 A few months after his arrival , when the days were cooler , and the people did not sleep so much as usual , a great feast was held a little way out of the town , and to this feast everyone flocked from thirty miles and more .
17 Some walked and some rode , some came in beautiful golden coaches ; but all had on splendid dresses of red or blue , while wreaths of flowers rested on their hair .
18 It was the first time that the youth had been present on such an occasion , and he stood silently aside watching the graceful dances and the pretty games played by the young people .
19 And as he watched , he noticed one girl , dressed in white with scarlet pomegranates in her hair , who seemed to him lovelier than all the rest .
20 When the feast was over , and the young man returned home , his manner was so strange that it drew the attention of all his friends .
21 Through his work next day the youth continued to see the girl 's face , throwing the ball to her companions , or threading her XXXXX between them as she danced .	way		attention|bag|dresses|everything|games|native|occasion|sun|town|way

3 And Father Grumbler , who had no wish to go on , called out between his hops : ` Stop then , ca n't you ?
4 That is enough for to-day ! '
5 But the switch paid no attention , and dealt out its blows as before , and MIGHT have been dealing them to this day , if the Holy Man had not heard their cries and come to the rescue .
6 ` Into the bag , quick ! '
7 said he , and the switch obeyed .
8 ` Now go and fetch me the cock and the basket , ' and the woman went without a word , and placed them on the table .
9 ` You have all got what you deserved , ' continued the Holy Man , ` and I have no pity for any of you .
10 I shall take my treasures home , and perhaps some day I may find a man who knows how to make the best of the chances that are given to him .
11 But that will never be YOU , ' he added , turning to Father Grumbler .

1 The girl had been born in the town , and had scarcely ever left it ; but the young man was a native of another country , and had only come to the city near the great river because he could find no work to do where he was .
2 A few months after his arrival , when the days were cooler , and the people did not sleep so much as usual , a great feast was held a little way out of the town , and to this feast everyone flocked from thirty miles and more .
3 Some walked and some rode , some came in beautiful golden coaches ; but all had on splendid dresses of red or blue , while wreaths of flowers rested on their hair .
4 It was the first time that the youth had been present on such an occasion , and he stood silently aside watching the graceful dances and the pretty games played by the young people .
5 And as he watched , he noticed one girl , dressed in white with scarlet pomegranates in her hair , who seemed to him lovelier than all the rest .
6 When the feast was over , and the young man returned home , his manner was so strange that it drew the attention of all his friends .
7 Through his work next day the youth continued to see the girl 's face , throwing the ball to her companions , or threading her way between them as she danced .
8 At night sleep fled from him , and after tossing for hours on his bed , he would get up and plunge into a deep pool that lay a little way in the forest .
9 This state of things went on for some weeks , then at last chance favoured him .
10 One evening , as he was passing near the house where she lived , he saw her standing with her back to the wall , trying to beat off with her fan the attacks of a savage dog that was leaping at her throat .
11 Alonzo , for such was his name , sprang forward , and with one blow of his fist stretched the creature dead upon the road .
12 He then helped the frightened and half-fainting girl into the large cool verandah where her parents were sitting , and from that hour he was a welcome guest in the house , and it was not long before he was the promised husband of Julia .

3 Oh , I have seen it , and more than one betrothed maiden lives alone , broken-hearted .

5 And opening a curiously carved box , she took out a sea-shell shot with many colours , and sang a song softly into it .

9 The moon was shining on the distant river , which looked cool and inviting , and the trees of the forest seemed to stretch out their arms and beckon him near .
10 But the young man steadily turned his face in the other direction , and went home to bed .
11 The struggle had been hard , but Alonzo had his reward next day in the joy and relief with which Julia greeted him .
12 He assured her that having overcome the temptation once the danger was now over ; but she , knowing better than he did the magic of the Yara 's face and voice , did not fail to make him repeat his promise when he went away .
13 For three nights Alonzo kept his word , not because he believed in the Yara , for he thought that the tales about her were all nonsense , but because he could not bear the tears with which he knew that Julia would greet him , if he confessed that he had returned to the forest .
14 But , in spite of this , the song rang in his ears , and daily grew louder .
15 On the fourth night the attraction of the forest grew so strong that neither the thought of Julia nor the promises he had made her could hold him back .
16 At eleven o'clock he plunged into the cool darkness of the trees , and took the path that led straight to the river .

1 Yet , for the first time , he found that Julia 's warnings , though he had laughed at her at the moment , had remained in his memory , and he glanced at the bushes with a certain sense of fear which was quite new to him .
2 When he reached the river he paused and looked round for a moment to make sure that the strange feeling of some one watching him was fancy , and he was really alone .
3 But the moon shone brightly on every tree , and nothing was to be seen but his own shadow ; nothing was to be heard but the sound of the rippling stream .
4 He threw off his clothes , and was just about to dive in headlong , when something -- he did not know what -- suddenly caused him to look round .
5 At the same instant the moon passed from behind a cloud , and its rays fell on a beautiful golden-haired woman standing half hidden by the ferns .
6 With one bound he caught up his mantle , and rushed headlong down the path he had come , fearing at each step to feel a hand laid on his shoulder .
7 It was not till he had left the last trees behind him , and was standing in the open plain , that he dared to look round , and then he thought a figure in white was still standing there waving her arms to and fro .
8 This was enough ; he ran along the road harder than ever , and never paused till he was save in his own room .
9 With the earliest rays of dawn he went back to the forest to see whether he could find any traces of the Yara , but though he searched every clump of bushes , and looked up every tree , everything was empty , and the only voices he heard were those of parrots , which are so ugly that they only drive people away .

11 But either that was harder than usual , or he must be ill , for he could not fix his mind upon it , and everybody he came across during the day inquired if anything had happened to give him that white , frightened look . '
12 I must be feverish , ' he said to himself ; ` after all , it is rather dangerous to take a cold bath when one is feeling so hot . '
13 Yet he knew , while he said it , that he was counting the hours for night to come , that he might return to the forest .
14 In the evening he went as usual to the creeper-covered house .
15 But he had better have stayed away , as his face was so pale and his manner so strange , that the poor girl saw that something terrible had occurred .
16 Alonzo , however , refused to answer any of her questions , and all she could get was a promise to hear everything the next day .
17 On pretence of a violent headache , he left Julia much earlier than usual and hurried quickly home .
18 Taking down a pistol , he loaded it and put it in his belt , and a little before midnight he stole out on the tips of his toes , so as to disturb nobody .

2 He did not stop till he had reached the river pool , when holding the pistol in his hand , he looked about him .
3 At every little noise -- the falling of a leaf , the rustle of an animal in the bushes , the cry of a night-bird -- he sprang up and cocked his pistol in the direction of the sound .
4 But though the moon still shone he saw nothing , and by and by a kind of dreamy state seemed to steal over him as he leant against a tree .
5 How long he remained in this condition he could not have told , but suddenly he awoke with a start , on hearing his name uttered softly .
6 ` Who is that ? '
7 he cried , standing upright instantly ; but only an echo answered him .
8 Then his eyes grew fascinated with the dark waters of the pool close to his feet , and he looked at it as if he could never look away .
9 He gazed steadily into the depths for some minutes , when he became aware that down in the darkness was a bright spark , which got rapidly bigger and brighter .
10 Again that feeling of awful fear took possession of him , and he tried to turn his eyes from the pool .
11 But it was no use ; something stronger than himself compelled him to keep them there .
12 At last the waters parted softly , and floating on the surface he saw the beautiful woman whom he had fled from only a few nights before .
13 He turned to run , but his feet were glued to the spot .
14 She smiled at him and held out her arms , but as she did so there came over him the remembrance of Julia , as he had seen her a few hours earlier , and her warnings and fears for the very danger in which he now found himself .
15 Meanwhile the figure was always drawing nearer , nearer ; but , with a violent effort , Alonzo shook off his stupor , and taking aim at her shoulder he pulled the trigger .
16 The report awoke the sleeping echoes , and was repeated all through the forest , but the figure smiled still , and went on advancing .
17 Again Alonzo fired , and a second time the bullet whistled through the air , and the figure advanced nearer .
18 A moment more , and she would be at his side .
19 Then , his pistol being empty , he grasped the barrel with both hands , and stood ready to use it as a club should the Yara approach and closer .
20 But now it seemed her turn to feel afraid , for she paused an instant while he pressed forward , still holding the pistol above his head , prepared to strike .
21 In his excitement he had forgotten the river , and it was not till the cold water touched his XXXXX that he stood still by instinct .	feet		club|cry|effort|eyes|feet|leaf|remembrance|rustle|stupor|surface

9 The Yara saw that he was wavering , and suffering herself to sway gently backwards and forwards on the surface of the river , she began to sing .
10 The song floated through the trees , now far and now near ; no one could tell whence it came , the whole air seemed full of it .

12 His arms dropped heavily to his side , but in falling struck against the sea shell , which , as he had promised Julia , he had always carried in his coat .

9 The Cunning Hare In a very cold country , far across the seas , where ice and snow cover the ground for many months in the year , there lived a little hare , who , as his father and mother were both dead , was brought up by his grandmother .
10 As he was too young , and she was too old , to work , they were very poor , and often did not have enough to eat .
11 One day , when the little fellow was hungrier than usual , he asked his grandmother if he might go down to the river and catch a fish for their breakfast , as the thaw had come and the water was flowing freely again .
12 She laughed at him for thinking that any fish would let itself be caught by a hare , especially such a young one ; but as she had the rheumatism very badly , and could get no food herself , she let him go .
13 ` If he does not catch a fish he may find something else , ' she said to herself .
14 So she told her grandson where to look for the net , and how he was to set it across the river ; but just as he was starting , feeling himself quite a man , she called him back .
15 ` After all , I do n't know what is the use of your going , my boy !
16 For even if you should catch a fish , I have no fire to cook it with . '
17 ` Let me catch my fish , and I will soon make you a fire , ' he answered gaily , for he was young , and knew nothing about the difficulties of fire-making .
18 It took him some time to haul the net through bushes and over fields , but at length he reached a pool in the river which he had often heard was swarming with fish , and here he set the net , as his grandmother had directed him .
19 He was so excited that he hardly slept all night , and at the very first streak of dawn he ran as fast as ever he could down to the river .

6 The Turtle and His Bride There was once a turtle who lived among a great many people of different kinds , in a large camp near a big river which was born right up amongst the snows , and flowed straight away south till it reached a sea where the water was always hot .
7 There were many other turtles in the camp , and this turtle was kind and pleasant to them all , but he did not care for any of them very much , and felt rather lonely .
8 At last he built himself a hut , and filled it with skins for seats , and made it as comfortable as any hut for miles round ; and when it was quite finished he looked about among the young women to see which of them he should ask to be his wife .
9 It took him some time to make up his mind , for no turtle likes being hurried , but at length he found one girl who seemed prettier and more industrious than the rest , and one day he entered her home , and said : ` Will you marry me ? '
10 The young woman was so surprised at this question that she dropped the beaded slipper she was making , and stared at the turtle .
11 She felt inclined to laugh -- the idea was so absurd ; but she was kind-hearted and polite , so she looked as grave as she could , and answered : ` But how are you going to provide for a family ?
12 Why , when the camp moves , you will not even be able to keep up with the rest ! ' '
13 I can keep up with the best of them , ' replied the turtle , tossing his head .
14 But though he was very much offended he did not let the girl see it , and begged and , prayed her so hard to marry him that , at last , she consented , very unwillingly .
15 ` You will have to wait till the spring , though , ' she said ; ' I must make a great many slippers and dresses for myself , as I shall not have much time afterwards . '
16 This did not please the turtle ; but he knew it was no use talking , so all he answered was : ' I shall go to war and take some captives , and I shall be away several months .
17 And when I return I shall expect you to be ready to marry me . '

19 The first thing he did was to call all his relations together , and ask them if they would come with him and make war on the people of a neighbouring village .
