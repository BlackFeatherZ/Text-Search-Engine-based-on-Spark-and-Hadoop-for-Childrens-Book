1 But neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for ; because Prigio invented a story that the mountain was enchanted , and that , as long as the Firedrake lived , everyone who came there fell asleep .
2 He did tell them about the flying carpet , however , which of course did not much surprise them , because they had read all about it in the Arabian Nights and other historical works .
3 `` And now I 'll show you fun ! ''
4 said Prigio ; and he asked them both to take their seats on the carpet , and wished to be in the valley of the Remora .
5 There they were in a moment , among the old knights whom , if you remember , the Remora had frozen into stone .
6 There was quite a troop of them , in all sorts of armour -- Greek and Roman , and Knight Templars like Front ' de Bouf and Brian du Bois Gilbert -- all the brave warriors that had tried to fight the Remora since the world began .
7 Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps , and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight .

1 For the prince remained as clever as ever he had been ; but , as nobody observed it , he became the most popular prince , and finally the best-beloved king who had ever sat on the throne of Pantouflia .

10 The king and queen were sitting in the royal library , of which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in all languages , all equally familiar to King Prigio .
11 The queen could not read most of them herself , but the king used to read them aloud to her .
12 A good many years had passed -- seventeen , in fact -- since Queen Rosalind was married , but you would not think it to look at her .
13 Her grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful , her dark hair as dark , and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing , as on the day when she was a bride .
14 And she was as fond of the king as when he was only Prince Prigio , and he was as fond of her as on the night when he first met her at the ball .
15 `` No , I do n't know what to do with Dick , '' said the king .
16 He meant his son , Prince Ricardo , but he called him Dick in private .
17 `` I believe it 's the fault of his education , '' his Majesty went on .

3 And anyone may see that , if you are a magician , like the Princess Jaqueline , a great many difficult questions as to what is right and wrong at once occur which do not trouble other people .
4 King Prigio 's secret , why he sent for the tailor and the other people , was his own secret .
5 The princess decided that she would not find it out by turning herself into Rip or the cat -LRB- whose name was Semiramis -RRB- , and , so far , she was quite right .
6 But she was very young , and it never occurred to her that it was just as wrong to find out what the king meant by drinking the moon as by listening in disguise .
7 As she grew older she learned to know better ; but this is just the danger of teaching young girls magic , and for that very reason it has been given up in most countries .
8 However , the princess did not think about right and wrong , unluckily .
9 She went to the bookcase and took down her Cornelius Agrippa , in one great tall black volume , with silver clasps which nobody else could open ; for , as the princess said , there are books which it would never do to leave lying about where the servants or anybody could read them .
10 Nobody could undo the clasps , however strong or clever he might be ; but the princess just breathed on them and made a sign , and the book flew open at the right place -- Book IV. , chapter vi. , about the middle of page 576 .
11 The magic spell was in Latin , of course ; but the princess knew Latin very well , and soon she had the magic song by heart .
12 Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf .
13 Then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains , and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame , opposite the window .
14 And into that mirror the moon shone white and full , filling all the space of it , so that the room was steeped in a strange silver light .
15 Now the whole room seemed to sway gently , waving and trembling ; and as it trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music , as if it were filled with the waves of the sea .
16 Then the princess took a great silver basin , covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver .
17 She poured water into the basin , and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the Latin book .
18 It was something like this , in English : `` Oh Lady Moon , on the waters riding , On shining waters , in silver sheen , Show me the secret the heart is hiding , Show me the truth of the thought , oh Queen !
19 `` Oh waters white , where the moon is riding , That knows what shall be and what has been , Tell me the secret the heart is hiding , Wash me the truth of it , clear and clean ! ''
20 As she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled , and then fell still again ; and the princess knelt in the middle of the room , and the moon and the white light from the mirror of the moon fell in the water .
21 Then the princess raised the basin , and stooped her mouth to it and drank the water , spilling a few drops , and so she drank the XXXXX and the knowledge of the moon .	moon		Nobody|anyone|book|course|everything|moon|silver|volume|waters|way
