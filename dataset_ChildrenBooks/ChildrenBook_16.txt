3 Her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance , as they had never expected to see her again , and there was no end to the questions they asked her .
4 She had also much to hear about what had happened to them while she was away , and of her father 's journey home .
5 But when they heard that she had only come to be with them for a short time , and then must go back to the Beast 's palace for ever , they lamented loudly .
6 Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams , and why the Prince constantly begged her not to trust to appearances .
7 After much consideration , he answered : `` You tell me yourself that the Beast , frightful as he is , loves you dearly , and deserves your love and gratitude for his gentleness and kindness ; I think the Prince must mean you to understand that you ought to reward him by doing as he wishes you to , in spite of his ugliness . ''
8 Beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable ; still , when she thought of her dear Prince who was so handsome , she did not feel at all inclined to marry the Beast .
9 At any rate , for two months she need not decide , but could enjoy herself with her sisters .
10 But though they were rich now , and lived in town again , and had plenty of acquaintances , Beauty found that nothing amused her very much ; and she often thought of the palace , where she was so happy , especially as at home she never once dreamed of her dear Prince , and she felt quite sad without him .
11 Then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her , and even found her rather in the way , so she would not have been sorry when the two months were over but for her father and brothers , who begged her to stay , and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure that she had not the courage to say good-by to them .
12 Every day when she got up she meant to say it at night , and when night came she put it off again , until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her mind .
13 She thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace gardens , when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave , and running quickly to see what could be the matter , she found the Beast stretched out upon his side , apparently dying .
14 He reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress , and at the same moment a stately lady appeared , and said very gravely : `` Ah !
15 Beauty , you are only just in time to save his life .
16 See what happens when people do not keep their promises !
17 If you had delayed one day more , you would have found him dead . ''
18 Beauty was so terrified by this dream that the next morning she announced her intention of going back at once , and that very night she said good-by to her father and all her brothers and sisters , and as soon as she was in bed she turned her ring round upon her finger , and said firmly , `` I wish to go back to my palace and see my Beast again , '' as she had been told to do .
19 Then she fell asleep instantly , and only woke up to hear the clock saying `` Beauty , Beauty '' twelve times in its musical voice , which told her at once that she was really in the palace once more .
20 Everything was just as before , and her birds were so glad to see her !

18 THE MASTER-MAID Once upon a time there was a king who had many sons .
19 I do not exactly know how many there were , but the youngest of them could not stay quietly at home , and was determined to go out into the world and try his luck , and after a long time the King was forced to give him leave to go .
20 When he had traveled about for several days , he came to a giant 's house , and hired himself to the giant as a servant .
21 In the morning the giant had to go out to pasture his goats , and as he was leaving the XXXXX he told the King 's son that he must clean out the stable .	house		Long|avenue|companion|consent|father|house|palace|place|servant|splendor

1 Beauty , who had half expected that he would be angry with her , was reassured by his gentle voice , and went back to the palace , where supper was awaiting her ; and afterward the Beast came in as usual , and talked about the time she had spent with her father , asking if she had enjoyed herself , and if they had all been very glad to see her .
2 Beauty answered politely , and quite enjoyed telling him all that had happened to her .
3 And when at last the time came for him to go , and he asked , as he had so often asked before , `` Beauty , will you marry me ? ''
4 She answered softly , `` Yes , dear Beast . ''
5 As she spoke a blaze of light sprang up before the windows of the palace ; fireworks crackled and guns banged , and across the avenue of orange trees , in letters all made of fire-flies , was written : `` Long live the Prince and his Bride . ''
6 Turning to ask the Beast what it could all mean , Beauty found that he had disappeared , and in his place stood her long-loved Prince !
7 At the same moment the wheels of a chariot were heard upon the terrace , and two ladies entered the room .
8 One of them Beauty recognized as the stately lady she had seen in her dreams ; the other was also so grand and queenly that Beauty hardly knew which to greet first .
9 But the one she already knew said to her companion : `` Well , Queen , this is Beauty , who has had the courage to rescue your son from the terrible enchantment .
10 They love one another , and only your consent to their marriage is wanting to make them perfectly happy . ''
11 `` I consent with all my heart , '' cried the Queen .
12 `` How can I ever thank you enough , charming girl , for having restored my dear son to his natural form ? ''
13 And then she tenderly embraced Beauty and the Prince , who had meanwhile been greeting the Fairy and receiving her congratulations .
14 `` Now , '' said the Fairy to Beauty , `` I suppose you would like me to send for all your brothers and sisters to dance at your wedding ? ''
15 And so she did , and the marriage was celebrated the very next day with the utmost splendor , and Beauty and the Prince lived happily ever after .

1 THE MASTER-MAID Once upon a time there was a king who had many sons .
2 I do not exactly know how many there were , but the youngest of them could not stay quietly at home , and was determined to go out into the world and try his luck , and after a long time the King was forced to give him leave to go .
3 When he had traveled about for several days , he came to a giant 's house , and hired himself to the giant as a servant .
4 In the morning the giant had to go out to pasture his goats , and as he was leaving the house he told the King 's son that he must clean out the stable .
5 `` And after you have done that , '' he said , `` you need not do any more work to-day , for you have come to a kind master , and that you shall find .
6 But what I set you to do must be done both well and thoroughly , and you must on no account go into any of the rooms which lead out of the room in which you slept last night .
7 If you do , I will take your life . ''
8 `` Well to be sure , he is an easy master ! ''
9 said the Prince to himself as he walked up and down the room humming and singing , for he thought there would be plenty of time left to clean out the stable ; `` but it would be amusing to steal a glance into his other rooms as well , '' thought the Prince , `` for there must be something that he is afraid of my seeing , as I am not allowed to enter them . ''
10 So he went into the first room .
11 A cauldron was hanging from the walls ; it was boiling , but the Prince could see no fire under it .
12 `` I wonder what is inside it , '' he thought , and dipped a lock of his hair in , and the hair became just as if it were all made of copper .
13 `` That 's a nice kind of soup .
14 If anyone were to taste that his throat would be gilded , '' said the youth , and then he went into the next chamber .
15 There , too , a cauldron was hanging from the wall , bubbling and boiling , but there was no fire under this either .
16 `` I will just try what this is like too , '' said the Prince , thrusting another lock of his hair into it , and it came out silvered over .
17 `` Such costly soup is not to be had in my father 's palace , '' said the Prince ; `` but everything depends on how it tastes , '' and then he went into the third room .
18 There , too , a cauldron was hanging from the wall , boiling , exactly the same as in the two other rooms , and the Prince took pleasure in trying this also , so he dipped a lock of hair in , and it came out so brightly gilded that it shone again .
19 `` Some talk about going from bad to worse , '' said the Prince ; `` but this is better and better .
20 If he boils gold here , what can he boil in there ? ''
21 He was determined to see , and went through the door into the fourth XXXXX .	room		account|copper|gold|master|pasture|room|servant|son|soup|throat

6 If he boils gold here , what can he boil in there ? ''
7 He was determined to see , and went through the door into the fourth room .
8 No cauldron was to be seen there , but on a bench someone was seated who was like a king 's daughter , but , whosoever she was , she was so beautiful that never in the Prince 's life had he seen her equal .
9 `` Oh !
10 in heaven 's name what are you doing here ? ''
11 said she who sat upon the bench .
12 `` I took the place of servant here yesterday , '' said the Prince .
13 `` May you soon have a better place , if you have come to serve here ! ''
14 said she .
15 `` Oh , but I think I have got a kind master , '' said the Prince .
16 `` He has not given me hard work to do to-day .
17 When I have cleaned out the stable I shall be done . ''
18 `` Yes , but how will you be able to do that ? ''
19 she asked again .
20 `` If you clean it out as other people do , ten pitchforksful will come in for every one you throw out .
21 But I will teach you how to do it ; you must turn your pitchfork upside down , and XXXXX with the handle , and then all will fly out of its own accord . ''	work		I|everything|gold|hair|lock|name|place|pleasure|talk|work

19 `` Yes , I will attend to that , '' said the Prince , and stayed sitting where he was the whole day , for it was soon settled between them that they would marry each other , he and the King 's daughter ; so the first day of his service with the giant did not seem long to him .
20 But when evening was drawing near she said that it would now be better for him to clean out the stable before the giant came home .
21 When he got there he had a fancy to try if what she had said were true , so he began to work in the same way that he had seen the stable-boys doing in his father 's stables , but he soon saw that he must give up that , for when he had worked a very short time he had scarcely any XXXXX left to stand .	room		May|daughter|day|gold|people|pitchfork|room|rooms|service|work

18 `` Well , well , I will soon find a cure for that ; I have only to call my river-sucker , '' said the giant , and he did call him .

20 `` Now you must throw out the lump of salt , '' said the Master-maid , and the Prince did so , and it grew up into such a great high mountain right across the sea that the giant could not come over it , and the river-sucker could not drink any more water .

7 When he had slept again for many hours , he began to move and stretch himself .
8 `` Is it not done yet ? ''

11 Then the giant began to sit up and rub his eyes , but he could not see who it was who had spoken to him , so he asked for the Master-maid , and called her .
12 But there was no one to give him an answer .
13 `` Ah !
14 well , she has just stolen out for a little , '' thought the giant , and he took a spoon , and went off to the cauldron to have a taste ; but there was nothing in it but shoe-soles , and rags , and such trumpery as that , and all was boiled up together , so that he could not tell whether it was porridge or milk pottage .
15 When he saw this , he understood what had happened , and fell into such a rage that he hardly knew what he was doing .

21 But just as the hole was made , and the river-sucker was beginning to drink , the Master-maid told the Prince to throw one or two drops out of the flask , and when he did this the XXXXX instantly became full of water again , and before the river-sucker could take one drink they reached the land and were in safety .	sea		answer|eyes|mountain|nothing|rage|sea|spoon|taste|time|wind

1 `` Wait here the least little bit of time , while I go home for the seven horses which stand in my father 's stable , '' said he ; `` it is not far off , and I shall not be long away , but I will not let my betrothed bride go on foot to the palace . ''
2 `` Oh !

4 `` How could I forget you ?
5 We have suffered so much evil together , and love each other so much , '' said the Prince ; and he insisted on going home for the coach with the seven horses , and she was to wait for him there , by the sea-shore .
6 So at last the Master-maid had to yield , for he was so absolutely determined to do it .
7 `` But when you get there you must not even give yourself time to greet anyone , but go straight into the stable , and take the horses , and put them in the coach , and drive back as quickly as you can .
8 For they will all come round about you ; but you must behave just as if you did not see them , and on no account must you taste anything , for if you do it will cause great misery both to you and to me , '' said she ; and this he promised .
9 But when he got home to the King 's palace one of his brothers was just going to be married , and the bride and all her kith and kin had come to the palace ; so they all thronged round him , and questioned him about this and that , and wanted him to go in with them ; but he behaved as if he did not see them , and went straight to the stable , and got out the horses and began to harness them .
10 When they saw that they could not by any means prevail on him to go in with them , they came out to him with meat and drink , and the best of everything that they had prepared for the wedding ; but the Prince refused to touch anything , and would do nothing but put the horses in as quickly as he could .
11 At last , however , the bride 's sister rolled an apple across the yard to him , and said : `` As you wo n't eat anything else , you may like to take a bite of that , for you must be both hungry and thirsty after your long journey . ''
12 And he took up the apple and bit a piece out of it .
13 But no sooner had he got the piece of apple in his mouth than he forgot the Master-maid and that he was to go back in the coach to fetch her .
14 `` I think I must be mad !
15 what do I want with this coach and horses ? ''

6 He was greatly astonished when he saw the gold hut shining and glittering there in the copse , and he was still more astonished when he went in and caught sight of the beautiful young maiden who was sitting there ; he fell in love with her at once , and straightway on the spot he begged her , both prettily and kindly , to marry him .
7 `` Well , but have you a great deal of money ? ''

9 `` Oh !
10 yes ; so far as that is concerned , I am not ill off , '' said the sheriff .

12 Well , as he had such a fine lot of money , the Master-maid said she would have him , so they sat down to talk .
13 But scarcely had they sat down together before the Master-maid wanted to jump up again .
14 `` I have forgotten to see to the fire , '' she said .
15 `` Why should you jump up to do that ? ''
16 said the sheriff ; `` I will do that ! ''
17 So he jumped up , and went to the chimney in one bound .
18 `` Just tell me when you have got hold of the shovel , '' said the Master-maid .
19 `` Well , I have hold of it now , '' said the sheriff .
20 `` Then you may hold the shovel , and the shovel you , and pour red-hot coals over you , till day dawns , '' said the Master-maid .

12 He saw how brightly the hut shone and gleamed through the wood , and he too went into it to see who lived there , and when he entered and saw the beautiful young maiden he fell even more in love with her than the sheriff had done , and began to woo her at once .
13 So the Master-maid asked him , as she had asked the sheriff , if he had a great deal of money , and the attorney said he was not ill off for that , and would at once go home to get it ; and at night he came with a great big sack of money -- this time it was a four-bushel sack -- and set it on the bench by the Master-maid .
14 So she promised to have him , and he sat down on the bench by her to arrange about it , but suddenly she said that she had forgotten to lock the door of the porch that night , and must do it .
15 `` Why should you do that ? ''
16 said the attorney ; `` sit still , I will do it . ''

18 `` Tell me when you have got hold of the door-latch , '' said the Master-maid .

2 The next day the attorney came riding by the place where the Master-maid dwelt .
3 He saw how brightly the hut shone and gleamed through the wood , and he too went into it to see who lived there , and when he entered and saw the beautiful young maiden he fell even more in love with her than the sheriff had done , and began to woo her at once .
4 So the Master-maid asked him , as she had asked the sheriff , if he had a great deal of money , and the attorney said he was not ill off for that , and would at once go home to get it ; and at night he came with a great big sack of money -- this time it was a four-bushel sack -- and set it on the bench by the Master-maid .
5 So she promised to have him , and he sat down on the bench by her to arrange about it , but suddenly she said that she had forgotten to lock the door of the porch that night , and must do it .
6 `` Why should you do that ? ''
7 said the attorney ; `` sit still , I will do it . ''
8 So he was on his feet in a moment , and out in the porch .
9 `` Tell me when you have got hold of the door-latch , '' said the Master-maid .
10 `` I have hold of it now , '' cried the attorney .
11 `` Then you may hold the door , and the door you , and may you go between wall and wall till day dawns . ''
12 What a dance the attorney had that night !
13 He had never had such a waltz before , and he never wished to have such a dance again .
14 Sometimes he was in front of the door , and sometimes the door was in front of him , and it went from one side of the porch to the other , till the attorney was well-nigh beaten to death .
15 At first he began to abuse the Master-maid , and then to beg and pray , but the door did not care for anything but keeping him where he was till break of day .
16 As soon as the door let go its hold of him , off went the attorney .
17 He forgot who ought to be paid off for what he had suffered , he forgot both his sack of money and his wooing , for he was so afraid lest the house-door should come dancing after him .
18 Everyone who met him stared and looked after him , for he was flying like a madman , and he could not have looked worse if a herd of rams had been butting at him all night long .
19 On the third day the bailiff came by , and he too saw the gold house in the little wood , and he too felt that he must go and see who lived there ; and when he caught sight of the Master-maid he became so much in love with her that he wooed her almost before he greeted her .
20 The Master-maid answered him as she had answered the other two , that if he had a great deal of money , she would have him .
21 `` So far as that is concerned , I am not ill off , '' said the XXXXX ; so he was at once told to go home and fetch it , and this he did .	bailiff		anything|attorney|bailiff|break|front|herd|hold|madman|sheriff|wall

3 He had never had such a waltz before , and he never wished to have such a dance again .
4 Sometimes he was in front of the door , and sometimes the door was in front of him , and it went from one side of the porch to the other , till the attorney was well-nigh beaten to death .
5 At first he began to abuse the Master-maid , and then to beg and pray , but the door did not care for anything but keeping him where he was till break of day .
6 As soon as the door let go its hold of him , off went the attorney .
7 He forgot who ought to be paid off for what he had suffered , he forgot both his sack of money and his wooing , for he was so afraid lest the house-door should come dancing after him .
8 Everyone who met him stared and looked after him , for he was flying like a madman , and he could not have looked worse if a herd of rams had been butting at him all night long .
9 On the third day the bailiff came by , and he too saw the gold house in the little wood , and he too felt that he must go and see who lived there ; and when he caught sight of the Master-maid he became so much in love with her that he wooed her almost before he greeted her .
10 The Master-maid answered him as she had answered the other two , that if he had a great deal of money , she would have him .
11 `` So far as that is concerned , I am not ill off , '' said the bailiff ; so he was at once told to go home and fetch it , and this he did .
12 At night he came back , and he had a still larger sack of money with him than the attorney had brought ; it must have been at least six bushels , and he set it down on the bench .
13 So it was settled that he was to have the Master-maid .
14 But hardly had they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring in the calf , and must go out to put it in the byre .
15 `` No , indeed , you shall not do that , '' said the bailiff ; `` I am the one to do that . ''
16 And , big and fat as he was , he went out as briskly as a boy .

15 `` Then may you hold the calf 's tail , and the calf 's tail hold you , and may you go round the world together till day dawns ! ''
16 said the Master-maid .
17 So the bailiff had to bestir himself , for the calf went over rough and smooth , over hill and dale , and , the more the bailiff cried and screamed , the faster the calf went .
18 When daylight began to appear , the bailiff was half dead ; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf 's tail , that he forgot the sack of money and all else .
19 He walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done , but , the slower he went , the more time had everyone to stare and look at him ; and they used it too , and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf .
20 On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King 's palace , and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride , and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister .
21 But when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the XXXXX one of the trace-pins broke , and , though they made one , two , and three to put in its place , that did not help them , for each broke in turn , no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of .	palace		Everyone|bailiff|boy|dale|day|herd|hill|madman|palace|sister

1 At first he began to abuse the Master-maid , and then to beg and pray , but the door did not care for anything but keeping him where he was till break of day .
2 As soon as the door let go its hold of him , off went the attorney .
3 He forgot who ought to be paid off for what he had suffered , he forgot both his sack of money and his wooing , for he was so afraid lest the house-door should come dancing after him .
4 Everyone who met him stared and looked after him , for he was flying like a madman , and he could not have looked worse if a herd of rams had been butting at him all night long .
5 On the third day the bailiff came by , and he too saw the gold house in the little wood , and he too felt that he must go and see who lived there ; and when he caught sight of the Master-maid he became so much in love with her that he wooed her almost before he greeted her .
6 The Master-maid answered him as she had answered the other two , that if he had a great deal of money , she would have him .
7 `` So far as that is concerned , I am not ill off , '' said the bailiff ; so he was at once told to go home and fetch it , and this he did .
8 At night he came back , and he had a still larger sack of money with him than the attorney had brought ; it must have been at least six bushels , and he set it down on the bench .
9 So it was settled that he was to have the Master-maid .
10 But hardly had they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring in the calf , and must go out to put it in the byre .
11 `` No , indeed , you shall not do that , '' said the bailiff ; `` I am the one to do that . ''
12 And , big and fat as he was , he went out as briskly as a boy .
13 `` Tell me when you have got hold of the calf 's tail , '' said the Master-maid .

1 `` So far as that is concerned , I am not ill off , '' said the bailiff ; so he was at once told to go home and fetch it , and this he did .
2 At night he came back , and he had a still larger sack of money with him than the attorney had brought ; it must have been at least six bushels , and he set it down on the bench .
3 So it was settled that he was to have the Master-maid .
4 But hardly had they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring in the calf , and must go out to put it in the byre .
5 `` No , indeed , you shall not do that , '' said the bailiff ; `` I am the one to do that . ''

11 So the bailiff had to bestir himself , for the calf went over rough and smooth , over hill and dale , and , the more the bailiff cried and screamed , the faster the calf went .
12 When daylight began to appear , the bailiff was half dead ; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf 's tail , that he forgot the sack of money and all else .
13 He walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done , but , the slower he went , the more time had everyone to stare and look at him ; and they used it too , and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf .
14 On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King 's palace , and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride , and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister .
15 But when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the palace one of the trace-pins broke , and , though they made one , two , and three to put in its place , that did not help them , for each broke in turn , no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of .
16 This went on for a long time , and they could not get away from the palace , so they were all in great trouble .
17 Then the sheriff said -LRB- for he too had been bidden to the wedding at Court -RRB- : `` Yonder away in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that she uses to make up her fire I know very well that it will hold fast . ''

1 So it was settled that he was to have the Master-maid .
2 But hardly had they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring in the calf , and must go out to put it in the byre .
3 `` No , indeed , you shall not do that , '' said the bailiff ; `` I am the one to do that . ''
4 And , big and fat as he was , he went out as briskly as a boy .
5 `` Tell me when you have got hold of the calf 's tail , '' said the Master-maid .
6 `` I have hold of it now , '' cried the bailiff .
7 `` Then may you hold the calf 's tail , and the calf 's tail hold you , and may you go round the world together till day dawns ! ''

9 So the bailiff had to bestir himself , for the calf went over rough and smooth , over hill and dale , and , the more the bailiff cried and screamed , the faster the calf went .
10 When daylight began to appear , the bailiff was half dead ; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf 's tail , that he forgot the sack of money and all else .
11 He walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done , but , the slower he went , the more time had everyone to stare and look at him ; and they used it too , and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf .
12 On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King 's palace , and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride , and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister .
13 But when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the palace one of the trace-pins broke , and , though they made one , two , and three to put in its place , that did not help them , for each broke in turn , no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of .
14 This went on for a long time , and they could not get away from the palace , so they were all in great trouble .
15 Then the sheriff said -LRB- for he too had been bidden to the wedding at Court -RRB- : `` Yonder away in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that she uses to make up her fire I know very well that it will hold fast . ''
16 So they sent off a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused ; so now they had a trace-pin which would not snap in two .

13 So they sent off a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused ; so now they had a trace-pin which would not snap in two .
14 But all at once , just as they were starting , the bottom of the coach fell in pieces .
15 They made a new bottom as fast as they could , but , no matter how they nailed it together , or what kind of wood they used , no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again , so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin .
16 Then the attorney said , for he too was at the wedding in the palace : `` Away there in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you could but get her to lend you one-half of her porch-door I am certain that it will hold together . ''
17 So they again sent a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily for the loan of the gilded porch-door of which the attorney had told them that they got it at once .
18 They were just setting out again , but now the horses were not able to draw the coach .
19 They had six horses already , and now they put in eight , and then ten , and then twelve , but the more they put in , and the more the coachman whipped them , the less good it did ; and the coach never stirred from the spot .
20 It was already beginning to be late in the day , and to church they must and would go , so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress .
21 Then the bailiff spoke up and said : `` Out there in the gilded cottage in the XXXXX dwells a girl , and if you could but get her to lend you her calf I know it could draw the coach , even if it were as heavy as a mountain .

1 And , big and fat as he was , he went out as briskly as a boy .
2 `` Tell me when you have got hold of the calf 's tail , '' said the Master-maid .
3 `` I have hold of it now , '' cried the bailiff .
4 `` Then may you hold the calf 's tail , and the calf 's tail hold you , and may you go round the world together till day dawns ! ''
5 said the Master-maid .
6 So the bailiff had to bestir himself , for the calf went over rough and smooth , over hill and dale , and , the more the bailiff cried and screamed , the faster the calf went .
7 When daylight began to appear , the bailiff was half dead ; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf 's tail , that he forgot the sack of money and all else .
8 He walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done , but , the slower he went , the more time had everyone to stare and look at him ; and they used it too , and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf .
