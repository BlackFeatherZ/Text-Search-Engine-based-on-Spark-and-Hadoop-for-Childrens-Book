12 Then she saw it was the long flat head of a serpent , and the recollection of the prophecy rushed into her mind .
13 Without waking her husband , she glided out of bed , and taking up a heavy bowl of milk which stood on a table , laid it on the floor in the path of the serpent -- for she knew that no serpent in the world can resist milk .
14 She held her breath as the snake drew near , and watched it throw up its head again as if it was smelling something nice , while its forky tongue darted out greedily .
15 At length its eyes fell upon the milk , and in an instant it was lapping it so fast that it was a wonder the creature did not choke , for it never took its head from the bowl as long as a drop was left in it .
16 After that it dropped on the ground and slept heavily .
17 This was what the princess had been waiting for , and catching up her husband 's sword , she severed the snake 's head from its body .

19 They gave him a magnificent burial , and then the prince had to examine the new laws which had been made in his absence , and do a great deal of business besides , till he grew quite ill from fatigue , and was obliged to go away to one of his palaces on the banks of the river , in order to rest .
20 Here he soon got better , and began to hunt , and to shoot wild duck with his bow ; and wherever he went , his dog , now grown very old , went with him .

1 When the prince and princess had been married a few months , the prince heard that his stepmother was dead , and his father was old and ill , and longing to have his eldest son by his side again .
2 The young man could not remain deaf to such a message , and he took a tender farewell of his wife , and set out on his journey home .
3 It was a long way , and he was forced to rest often on the road , and so it happened that , one night , when he was sleeping in a city on the banks of the great river , a huge crocodile came silently up and made its way along a passage to the prince 's room .
4 Fortunately one of his guards woke up as it was trying to steal past them , and shut the crocodile up in a large hall , where a giant watched over it , never leaving the spot except during the night , when the crocodile slept .
5 And this went on for more than a month .
6 Now , when the prince found that he was not likely to leave his father 's kingdom again , he sent for his wife , and bade the messenger tell her that he would await her coming in the town on the banks of the great river .
7 This was the reason why he delayed his journey so long , and narrowly escaped being eaten by the crocodile .
8 During the weeks that followed the prince amused himself as best he could , though he counted the minutes to the arrival of the princess , and when she did come , he at once prepared to start for the court .
9 That very night , however , while he was asleep , the princess noticed something strange in one of the corners of the room .
10 It was a dark patch , and seemed , as she looked , to grow longer and longer , and to be moving slowly towards the cushions on which the prince was lying .
11 She shrank in terror , but , slight as was the noise , the thing heard it , and raised its head to listen .
12 Then she saw it was the long flat head of a serpent , and the recollection of the prophecy rushed into her mind .

1 At length its eyes fell upon the milk , and in an instant it was lapping it so fast that it was a wonder the creature did not choke , for it never took its head from the bowl as long as a drop was left in it .
2 After that it dropped on the ground and slept heavily .
3 This was what the princess had been waiting for , and catching up her husband 's sword , she severed the snake 's head from its body .
4 The morning after this adventure the prince and princess set out for the king 's palace , but found when they reached it , that he was already dead .
5 They gave him a magnificent burial , and then the prince had to examine the new laws which had been made in his absence , and do a great deal of business besides , till he grew quite ill from fatigue , and was obliged to go away to one of his palaces on the banks of the river , in order to rest .
6 Here he soon got better , and began to hunt , and to shoot wild duck with his bow ; and wherever he went , his dog , now grown very old , went with him .
7 One morning the prince and his dog were out as usual , and in chasing their game they drew near the bank of the river .
8 The prince was running at full speed after his dog when he almost fell over something that looked like a log of wood , which was lying in his path .

3 The Fox and the Lapp Once upon a time a fox lay peeping out of his hole , watching the road that ran by at a little distance , and hoping to see something that might amuse him , for he was feeling very dull and rather cross .
4 For a long while he watched in vain ; everything seemed asleep , and not even a bird stirred overhead .
5 The fox grew crosser than ever , and he was just turning away in disgust from his place when he heard the sound of feet coming over the snow .
6 He crouched eagerly down at the edge of the road and said to himself : ' I wonder what would happen if I were to pretend to be dead !
7 This is a man driving a reindeer sledge , I know the tinkling of the harness .
8 And at any rate I shall have an adventure , and that is always something ! '
9 So he stretched himself out by the side of the road , carefully choosing a spot where the driver could not help seeing him , yet where the reindeer would not tread on him ; and all fell out just as he had expected .
10 The sledge-driver pulled up sharply , as his eyes lighted on the beautiful animal lying stiffly beside him , and jumping out he threw the fox into the bottom of the sledge , where the goods he was carrying were bound tightly together by ropes .
11 The fox did not move a muscle though his bones were sore from the fall , and the driver got back to his seat again and drove on merrily .
12 But before they had gone very far , the fox , who was near the edge , contrived to slip over , and when the Laplander saw him stretched out on the snow he pulled up his reindeer and put the fox into one of the other sledges that was fastened behind , for it was market-day at the nearest town , and the man had much to sell .
13 They drove on a little further , when some noise in the forest made the man turn his head , just in time to see the fox fall with a heavy thump on to the frozen snow .
14 ` That beast is bewitched ! '
15 he said to himself , and then he threw the fox into the last sledge of all , which had a cargo of fishes .
16 This was exactly what the cunning creature wanted , and he wriggled gently to the front and bit the cord which tied the sledge to the one before it so that it remained standing in the middle of the road .
17 Now there were so many sledges that the Lapp did not notice for a long while that one was missing ; indeed , he would have entered the town without knowing if snow had not suddenly begun to fall .

16 As soon as he had loosened the sledge , he had taken his favourite fish from among the piles neatly arranged for sale , and had trotted off to the forest with it in his mouth .
17 By-and-by he met a bear , who stopped and said : ` Where did you find that fish , Mr. Fox ? '
18 ` Oh , not far off , ' answered he ; ' I just stuck my tail in the stream close by the place where the elves dwell , and the fish hung on to it of itself . '
19 ` Dear me , ' snarled the bear , who was hungry and not in a good temper , ` if the fish hung on to your tail , I suppose he will hang on to mine . '

3 So he stretched himself out by the side of the road , carefully choosing a spot where the driver could not help seeing him , yet where the reindeer would not tread on him ; and all fell out just as he had expected .
4 The sledge-driver pulled up sharply , as his eyes lighted on the beautiful animal lying stiffly beside him , and jumping out he threw the fox into the bottom of the sledge , where the goods he was carrying were bound tightly together by ropes .
5 The fox did not move a muscle though his bones were sore from the fall , and the driver got back to his seat again and drove on merrily .
6 But before they had gone very far , the fox , who was near the edge , contrived to slip over , and when the Laplander saw him stretched out on the snow he pulled up his reindeer and put the fox into one of the other sledges that was fastened behind , for it was market-day at the nearest town , and the man had much to sell .
7 They drove on a little further , when some noise in the forest made the man turn his head , just in time to see the fox fall with a heavy thump on to the frozen snow .

12 ` Dear me , ' snarled the bear , who was hungry and not in a good temper , ` if the fish hung on to your tail , I suppose he will hang on to mine . '
13 ` Yes , certainly , grandfather , ' replied the fox , ` if you have patience to suffer what I suffered . '
14 ` Of course I can , ' replied the bear , ` what nonsense you talk !
15 Show me the way . '
16 So the fox led him to the bank of a stream , which , being in a warm place , had only lightly frozen in places , and was at this moment glittering in the spring sunshine .
17 ` The elves bathe here , ' he said , ` and if you put in your tail the fish will catch hold of it .
18 But it is no use being in a hurry , or you will spoil everything . '
19 Then he trotted off , but only went out of sight of the bear , who stood still on the bank with his tail deep in the water .
20 Soon the sun set and it grew very cold and the ice formed rapidly , and the bear 's tail was fixed as tight as if a vice had held it ; and when the fox saw that everything had happened just as he had planned it , he called out loudly : ` Be quick , good people , and come with your bows and spears .

2 he said to himself , and then he threw the fox into the last sledge of all , which had a cargo of fishes .
3 This was exactly what the cunning creature wanted , and he wriggled gently to the front and bit the cord which tied the sledge to the one before it so that it remained standing in the middle of the road .
4 Now there were so many sledges that the Lapp did not notice for a long while that one was missing ; indeed , he would have entered the town without knowing if snow had not suddenly begun to fall .
5 Then he got down to secure more firmly the cloths that kept his goods dry , and going to the end of the long row , discovered that the sledge containing the fish and the fox was missing .

7 The fox meanwhile was enjoying himself mightily .

4 ` It does not matter a straw how hard the work is , ' answered the bear eagerly , ' I will do it every bit . '

6 ` That is all right , ' said the fox at last , ' I see I was mistaken in you .

12 The bear did not like being told that he was not as brave as a bird , so he set his teeth and resolved to endure anything sooner than speak again ; but by this time the last willow band had burned through , and with a push the fox sent his victim tumbling into the grass , and ran off to hide himself in the forest .
13 After a while he stole cautiously and found , as he expected , nothing left but a few charred bones .
14 These he picked up and put in a bag , which he slung over his back .
15 By-and-by he met a Lapp driving his team of reindeer along the road , and as he drew near , the fox rattled the bones gaily .
16 ` That sounds like silver or gold , ' thought the man to himself .

1 But when the fire grew hotter still he moved uneasily from one foot to the other , saying , imploringly : ` It is getting rather warm , old man . '
2 But all the answer he got was : ' I thought you would never be able to suffer pain like those little birds . '
3 The bear did not like being told that he was not as brave as a bird , so he set his teeth and resolved to endure anything sooner than speak again ; but by this time the last willow band had burned through , and with a push the fox sent his victim tumbling into the grass , and ran off to hide himself in the forest .
4 After a while he stole cautiously and found , as he expected , nothing left but a few charred bones .
5 These he picked up and put in a bag , which he slung over his back .
6 By-and-by he met a Lapp driving his team of reindeer along the road , and as he drew near , the fox rattled the bones gaily .
7 ` That sounds like silver or gold , ' thought the man to himself .
8 And he said politely to the fox : ` Good-day , friend !
9 What have you got in your bag that makes such a strange sound ? '
10 ` All the wealth my father left me , ' answered the fox .
11 ` Do you feel inclined to bargain ? '
12 ` Well , I do n't mind , ' replied the Lapp , who was a prudent man , and did not wish the fox to think him too eager ; ` but show me first what money you have got . '
13 ` Ah , but I ca n't do that , ' answered the fox , ` my bag is sealed up .
14 But if you will give me those three reindeer , you shall take it as it is , with all its contents . '
15 The Lapp did not quite like it , but the fox spoke with such an air that his doubts melted away .
16 He nodded , and stretched out his hand ; the fox put the bag into it , and unharnassed the reindeer he had chosen .
17 ` Oh , I forgot ! '
18 he exclaimed , turning round , as he was about to drive them in the opposite direction , ` you must be sure not to open the bag until you have gone at least five miles , right on the other side of those hills out there .
19 If you do , you will find that all the gold and silver has changed into a parcel of charred bones . '

2 ` After all , it will be quite easy , ' thought he , and he bade a squirrel , who was watching him on a tree close by , take a message to all the robber beasts of the forest , and in less than half an hour a great crashing of branches was heard , and bears , wolves , snakes , mice , frogs , and other creatures came pressing up to the cave .
3 When they heard why they had been summoned , they declared themselves ready each one to do his part .
4 The bear took his crossbow from his neck and shot the reindeer in the chin ; and , from that day to this , every reindeer has a mark in that same spot , which is always known as the bear 's arrow .
5 The wolf shot him in the thigh , and the sign of his arrow still remains ; and so with the mouse and the viper and all the rest , even the frog ; and at the last the reindeer all died .

8 From there he set up the most frightful shrieks , so that the animals fled away in all directions .

10 The fox continued his shrieks till he felt sure that the animals must have got to a safe distance ; then he crawled out of his hiding-place and went to the bodies of the reindeer , which he now had all to himself .
11 He gathered a bundle of sticks for a fire , and was just preparing to cook a steak , when his enemy , the Lapp , came up , panting with haste and excitement .
12 ` What are you doing there ? '

14 And why , when you had got the reindeer , did you kill them ? '
15 ` Dear brother , ' answered the fox with a sob , ` do not blame me for this misfortune .
16 It is my comrades who have slain them in spite of my prayers . '
17 The man made no reply , for the white fur of the ermine , who was crouching with the mouse behind some stones , had just caught his eye .
18 He hastily seized the iron hook which hung over the fire and flung it at the little creature ; but the ermine was too quick for him , and the hook only touched the top of its tail , and that has remained black to this day .
19 As for the mouse , the Lapp threw a half-burnt stick after him , and though it was not enough to hurt him , his beautiful white skin was smeared all over with it , and all the washing in the world would not make him clean again .

4 ` Dear brother , ' answered the fox with a sob , ` do not blame me for this misfortune .
5 It is my comrades who have slain them in spite of my prayers . '
6 The man made no reply , for the white fur of the ermine , who was crouching with the mouse behind some stones , had just caught his eye .
7 He hastily seized the iron hook which hung over the fire and flung it at the little creature ; but the ermine was too quick for him , and the hook only touched the top of its tail , and that has remained black to this day .
8 As for the mouse , the Lapp threw a half-burnt stick after him , and though it was not enough to hurt him , his beautiful white skin was smeared all over with it , and all the washing in the world would not make him clean again .
9 And the man would have been wiser if he had let the ermine and the mouse alone , for when he turned round again he found he was alone .
10 Directly the fox noticed that his enemy 's attention had wandered from himself he watched his chance , and stole softly away till he had reached a clump of thick bushes , when he ran as fast as he could , till he reached a river , where a man was mending his boat .
11 ` Oh , I wish , I wish , I had a boat to mend too ! '
12 he cried , sitting up on his hind-legs and looking into the man 's face .
13 ` Stop your silly chatter ! '
14 answered the man crossly , ` or I will give you a bath in the river . '
15 ` Oh , I wish , I do wish , I had a boat to mend , ' cried the fox again , as if he had not heard .
16 And the man grew angry and seized him by the tail , and threw him far out in the stream close to the edge of an island ; which was just what the fox wanted .
17 He easily scrambled up , and sitting on the top , he called : ` Hasten , hasten , O fishes , and carry me to the other side ! '
18 And the fishes left the stones where they had been sleeping , and the pools where they had been feeding , and hurried to see who could get to the island first . '
19 I have won , ' shouted the pike .
20 ` Jump on my back , dear fox , and you will find yourself in a trice on the opposite shore . '

12 When everything was ready , and the water in the pot was getting hot , he popped him in , and waited till he thought the salmon was nearly boiled .
13 But as he stooped down the water gave a sudden fizzle , and splashed into the fox 's eyes , blinding him .
14 He started backwards with a cry of pain , and sat still for some minutes , rocking himself to and fro .
15 When he was a little better he rose and walked down a road till he met a grouse , who stopped and asked what was the matter .
16 ` Have you a pair of eyes anywhere about you ? '
17 asked the fox politely .

3 ` Well , you can have no fault to find with ME , ' put in the trout .
4 ` Good gracious !

6 exclaimed the fox .
7 ` But I 'm afraid to trust myself to you either . '
8 At this moment a fine salmon swam slowly up .
9 ` Ah , yes , you are the person I want , ' said the fox ; ` but come near , so that I may get on your back , without wetting my feet . '
