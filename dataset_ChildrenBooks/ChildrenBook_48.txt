1 In a pool of the river a whale was resting , blowing water into the air and making a lovely fountain .
2 The tortoise , however , was too young and too busy to admire such things , and he called to the whale to stop , as he wanted to speak to him .
3 ` Would you like to try which of us is the stronger ? '

5 The whale looked at him , sent up another fountain , and answered : ` Oh , yes ; certainly .

7 I am quite ready . '
8 ` Then give me one of your longest bones , and I will fasten it to my leg .
9 When I give the signal , you must pull , and we will see which can pull the hardest . '
10 ` Very good , ' replied the whale ; and he took out one of his bones and passed it to the tortoise .
11 The tortoise picked up the end of the bone in his mouth and went back to the elephant . '
12 I will fasten this to your leg , ' said he , ` in the same way as it is fastened to mine , and we must both pull as hard as we can .
13 We shall soon see which is the stronger . '
14 So he wound it carefully round the elephant 's leg , and tied it in a firm knot .
15 ` Now ! '
16 cried he , plunging into a thick bush behind him .
17 The whale tugged at one end , and the elephant tugged at the other , and neither had any idea that he had not the tortoise for his foe .
18 When the whale pulled hardest the elephant was dragged into the water ; and when the elephant pulled the hardest the whale was hauled on to the land .

15 ` You man , ' he said rudely , ` throw me down that big orange up there , or I will throw a stone at you . '
16 The wax figure took no notice of this request , so the monkey , who was easily made angry , picked up a stone , and flung it with all his force .

18 At this moment a breeze shook the tree , and the orange on which the monkey had set his heart dropped from the bough .
19 He picked it up and ate it every bit , including the rind , and it was so good he thought he should like another .
20 So he called again to the wax figure to throw him an orange , and as the figure did not move , he hurled another stone , which stuck to the wax as the first had done .

5 ` You man , ' he said rudely , ` throw me down that big orange up there , or I will throw a stone at you . '
6 The wax figure took no notice of this request , so the monkey , who was easily made angry , picked up a stone , and flung it with all his force .
7 But instead of falling to the ground again , the stone stuck to the soft wax .
8 At this moment a breeze shook the tree , and the orange on which the monkey had set his heart dropped from the bough .
9 He picked it up and ate it every bit , including the rind , and it was so good he thought he should like another .
10 So he called again to the wax figure to throw him an orange , and as the figure did not move , he hurled another stone , which stuck to the wax as the first had done .
11 Seeing that the man was quite indifferent to stones , the monkey grew more angry still , and climbing the tree hastily , gave the figure a violent kick .
12 But like the two stones his leg remained stuck to the wax , and he was held fast .
13 ` Let me go at once , or I will give you another kick , ' he cried , suiting the action to the word , and this time also his foot remained in the grasp of the man .
14 Not knowing what he did , the monkey hit out , first with one hand and then with the other , and when he found that he was literally bound hand and foot , he became so mad with anger and terror that in his struggles he fell to the ground , dragging the figure after him .
15 This freed his hands and feet , but besides the shock of the fall , they had tumbled into a bed of thorns , and he limped away broken and bruised , and groaning loudly ; for when monkeys ARE hurt , they take pains that everybody shall know it .
16 It was a long time before Jack was well enough to go about again ; but when he did , he had an encounter with his old enemy the puma .
17 And this was how it came about .
18 One day the puma invited his friend the stag to go with him and see a comrade , who was famous for the good milk he got from his cows .
19 The stag loved milk , and gladly accepted the invitation , and when the sun began to get a little low the two started on their walk .
20 On the way they arrived on the banks of a river , and as there were no bridges in those days it was necessary to swim across it .
21 The XXXXX was not fond of swimming , and began to say that he was tired , and thought that after all it was not worth going so far to get milk , and that he would return home .	stag		anger|banks|country|friend|part|stag|struggles|time|trees|word

1 The monkey gave a shriek of pain , and darted up into a tree , but when he saw that it was only the rabbit who had dared to insult him so , he chattered so fast in his anger , and looked so fierce , that the rabbit fled into the nearest hole , and stayed there for several days , trembling with fright .
2 Soon after this adventure the monkey went away into another part of the country , right on the outskirts of the forest , where there was a beautiful garden full of oranges hanging ripe from the trees .

12 The stag was not fond of swimming , and began to say that he was tired , and thought that after all it was not worth going so far to get milk , and that he would return home .
13 But the puma easily saw through these excuses , and laughed at him .
14 ` The river is not deep at all , ' he said ; ` why , you will never be off your feet .
15 Come , pluck up your courage and follow me . '
16 The stag was afraid of the river ; still , he was much more afraid of being laughed at , and he plunged in after the puma ; but in an instant the current had swept him away , and if it had not borne him by accident to a shallow place on the opposite side , where he managed to scramble up the bank , he would certainly have been drowned .
17 As it was , he scrambled out , shaking with terror , and found the puma waiting for him .
18 ` You had a narrow escape that time , ' said the puma .
19 After resting for a few minutes , to let the stag recover from his fright , they went on their way till they came to a grove of bananas .

1 ` Let me go at once , or I will give you another kick , ' he cried , suiting the action to the word , and this time also his foot remained in the grasp of the man .
2 Not knowing what he did , the monkey hit out , first with one hand and then with the other , and when he found that he was literally bound hand and foot , he became so mad with anger and terror that in his struggles he fell to the ground , dragging the figure after him .
3 This freed his hands and feet , but besides the shock of the fall , they had tumbled into a bed of thorns , and he limped away broken and bruised , and groaning loudly ; for when monkeys ARE hurt , they take pains that everybody shall know it .
4 It was a long time before Jack was well enough to go about again ; but when he did , he had an encounter with his old enemy the puma .
5 And this was how it came about .
6 One day the puma invited his friend the stag to go with him and see a comrade , who was famous for the good milk he got from his cows .

3 The monkey knew that the puma was not so good-natured for nothing , but he felt quite able to take care of himself , so he said he should have much pleasure in accompanying his friend .
4 They soon reached the same river , and , as before , the puma remarked : ` Friend monkey , you will find it very shallow ; there is no cause for fear .
5 Jump in and I will follow . '
6 ` Do you think you have the stag to deal with ? '
7 asked the monkey , laughing . '
8 I should prefer to follow ; if not I shall go no further .
9 The puma understood that it was useless trying to make the monkey do as he wished , so he chose a shallow place and began to swim across .
10 The monkey waited till the puma had got to the middle , then he gave a great spring and jumped on his back , knowing quite well that the puma would be afraid to shake him off , lest he should be swept away into deep water .
11 So in this manner they reached the bank .
12 The banana grove was not far distant , and here the puma thought he would pay the monkey out for forcing him to carry him over the river .
13 ` Friend monkey , look what fine bananas , ' cried he .
14 ` You are fond of climbing ; suppose you run up and throw me down a few .
15 You can eat the green ones , which are the nicest , and I will be content with the yellow . '
16 ` Very well , ' answered the monkey , swinging himself up ; but he ate all the yellow ones himself , and only threw down the green ones that were left .
17 The puma was furious and cried out : ' I will punch your head for that . '
18 But the monkey only answered : ` If you are gong to talk such nonsense I wo n't walk with you . '
19 And the puma was silent .
20 In a few minutes more they arrived at the field were the men were reaping the maize , and the puma remarked as he had done before : ` Friend monkey , if you wish to please these men , just say as you go by : `` Bad luck to all workers . ''
21 ` Very well , ' replied the XXXXX ; but , instead , he nodded and smiled , and said : ' I hope your industry may be rewarded as it deserves . '	monkey		Jump|back|bank|care|manner|middle|monkey|ones|place|pleasure

1 And the puma was silent .
2 In a few minutes more they arrived at the field were the men were reaping the maize , and the puma remarked as he had done before : ` Friend monkey , if you wish to please these men , just say as you go by : `` Bad luck to all workers . ''
3 ` Very well , ' replied the monkey ; but , instead , he nodded and smiled , and said : ' I hope your industry may be rewarded as it deserves . '
4 The men thanked him heartily , let him pass on , and the puma followed behind him .
5 Further along the path they saw the shining snake lying on the moss .
6 ` What a lovely necklace for your daughter , ' exclaimed the puma .
7 ` Pick it up and take it with you . '
8 ` You are very kind , but I will leave it for you , ' answered the monkey , and nothing more was said about the snake .
9 Not long after this they reached the comrade 's house , and found him just ready to go to bed .
10 So , without stopping to talk , the guests slung their hammocks , the monkey taking care to place his so high that no one could get at him .
11 Besides , he thought it would be more prudent not to fall asleep , so he only lay still and snored loudly .
12 When it was quite dark and no sound was to be heard , the puma crept out to the sheep-fold , killed the sheep , and carried back a bowl full of its blood with which to sprinkle the monkey .
13 But the monkey , who had been watching out of the corner of his eye , waited until the puma drew near , and with a violent kick upset the bowl all over the puma himself .
14 When the puma saw what had happened , he turned in a great hurry to leave the house , but before he could do so , he saw the shepherd coming , and hastily lay down again .

20 and with his stick he gave the puma such a blow on the head that he died then and there .

4 The Knights of the Fish Once upon a time there lived an old cobbler who worked hard at his trade from morning till night , and scarcely gave himself a moment to eat .
5 But , industrious as he was , he could hardly buy bread and cheese for himself and his wife , and they grew thinner and thinner daily .
6 For a long while whey pretended to each other that they had no appetite , and that a few blackberries from the hedges were a great deal nicer than a good strong bowl of soup .
7 But at length there came a day when the cobbler could bear it no longer , and he threw away his last , and borrowing a rod from a neighbour he went out to fish .
8 Now the cobbler was as patient about fishing as he had been about cobbling .
9 From dawn to dark he stood on the banks of the little stream , without hooking anything better than an eel , or a few old shoes , that even he , clever though he was , felt were not worth mending .
10 At length his patience began to give way , and as he undressed one night he said to himself : ` Well , I will give it one more chance ; and if I do n't catch a fish to-morrow , I will go and hang myself . '
11 He had not cast his line for ten minutes the next morning before he drew from the river the most beautiful fish he had ever seen in his life .
12 But he nearly fell into the water from surprise , when the fish began to speak to him , in a small , squeaky voice : ` Take me back to your hut and cook me ; then cut me up , and sprinkle me over with pepper and salt .
13 Give two of the pieces to your wife , and bury two more in the garden . '
14 The cobbler did not know what to make of these strange words ; but he was wiser than many people , and when he did not understand , he thought it was well to obey .
15 His children wanted to eat all the fish themselves , and begged their father to tell them what to do with the pieces he had put aside ; but the cobbler only laughed , and told them it was no business of theirs .
16 And when they were safe in bed he stole out and buried the two pieces in the garden .
17 By and by two babies , exactly alike , lay in a cradle , and in the garden were two tall plants , with two brilliant shields on the top .
18 Years passed away , and the babies were almost men .
19 They were tired of living quietly at home , being mistaken for each other by everybody they saw , and determined to set off in different directions , to seek adventures .
20 So , one fine morning , the two brothers left the hut , and walked together to the place where the great road divided .
21 There they embraced and parted , promising that if XXXXX remarkable had happened to either , he would return to the cross roads and wait till his brother came .	anything		anything|babies|bread|cheese|children|hedges|morning|people|river|rod

4 They were tired of living quietly at home , being mistaken for each other by everybody they saw , and determined to set off in different directions , to seek adventures .
5 So , one fine morning , the two brothers left the hut , and walked together to the place where the great road divided .
6 There they embraced and parted , promising that if anything remarkable had happened to either , he would return to the cross roads and wait till his brother came .
7 The youth who took the path that ran eastwards arrived presently at a large city , where he found everybody standing at the doors , wringing their hands and weeping bitterly .
8 ` What is the matter ? '
9 asked he , pausing and looking round .
10 And a man replied , in a faltering voice , that each year a beautiful girl was chosen by lot to be offered up to a dreadful fiery dragon , who had a mother even worse than himself , and this year the lot had fallen on their peerless princess .
11 ` But where IS the princess ? '
12 said the young man once more , and again the man answered him : ` She is standing under a tree , a mile away , waiting for the dragon . '
13 This time the Knight of the Fish did not stop to hear more , but ran off as fast as he could , and found the princess bathed in tears , and trembling from head to foot .
14 She turned as she heard the sound of his sword , and removed her handkerchief from his eyes .
15 ` Fly , ' she cried ; ` fly while you have yet time , before that monster sees you . '
16 She said it , and she mean it ; yet , when he had turned his back , she felt more forsaken than before .
17 But in reality it was not more than a few minutes before he came back , galloping furiously on a horse he had borrowed , and carrying a huge mirror across its neck . '
18 I am in time , then , ' he cried , dismounting very carefully , and placing the mirror against the trunk of a tree .
19 ` Give me your veil , ' he said hastily to the princess .
20 And when she had unwound it from her head he covered the mirror with it .
21 ` The moment the XXXXX comes near you , you must tear off the veil , ' cried he ; ` and be sure you hide behind the mirror .	dragon		directions|dragon|everybody|head|horse|men|mirror|path|princess|top
