8 The Prince is Puzzled .
9 Prince Prigio did not go to bed .
10 It was bright daylight , and he had promised to bring the horns and tail of a Firedrake as a present to a pretty lady .
11 He had said it was easy to do this ; but now , as he sat and thought over it , he did not feel so victorious .
12 `` First , '' he said , `` where is the Firedrake ? ''
13 He reflected for a little , and then ran upstairs to the garret .
14 `` It should be here ! ''
15 he cried , tossing the fairies ' gifts about ; `` and , by George , here it is ! ''
16 Indeed , he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which Prince Ali , in the Arabian Nights , bought in the bazaar in Schiraz .
17 Now , this glass was made so that , by looking through it , you could see anybody or anything you wished , however far away .
18 Prigio 's first idea was to look at his lady .
19 `` But she does not expect to be looked at , '' he thought ; `` and I wo n't ! ''
20 On the other hand , he determined to look at the Firedrake ; for , of course , he had no delicacy about spying on him , the brute .
21 The XXXXX clapped the glass to his eye , stared out of window , and there , sure enough , he saw the Firedrake .	prince		Embassy|day|doors|everything|fairies|gifts|ivory|lady|mothers|prince

1 He got introduced to her father too , and quite won his heart ; and , at last , he was invited to dine next day at the Embassy .
2 In Pantouflia , it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the royal family goes on dancing .
3 This ball lasted till the light came in , and the birds were singing out of doors , and all the mothers present were sound asleep .
4 Then nothing would satisfy the prince , but that they all should go home singing through the streets ; in fact , there never had been so merry a dance in all Pantouflia .
5 The prince had made a point of dancing with almost every girl there : and he had suddenly become the most beloved of the royal family .
6 But everything must end at last ; and the prince , putting on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet , flew back to his lonely castle .

4 Great burning stones were tossed up by the volcano , and nearly hit him several times .
5 Moreover , the steam and smoke , and the flames which the Firedrake spouted like foam from his nostrils , would have daunted even the bravest man .
6 The sides of the hill , too , were covered with the blackened ashes of his victims , whom he had roasted when they came out to kill him .
7 The garden-engine of poor little Alphonso was lying in the valley , all broken and useless .
8 But the Firedrake , as happy as a wild duck on a lonely loch , was rolling and diving in the liquid flame , all red-hot and full of frolic .
9 `` Hi ! ''
10 shouted the prince .
11 The Firedrake rose to the surface , his horns as red as a red crescent - moon , only bigger , and lashing the fire with his hoofs and his blazing tail .
12 `` Who 's there ? ''
13 he said in a hoarse , angry voice .
14 `` Just let me get at you ! ''
15 `` It 's me , '' answered the prince .
16 It was the first time he had forgotten his grammar , but he was terribly excited .
17 `` What do you want ? ''
18 grunted the beast .
19 `` I wish I could see you '' ; and , horrible to relate , he rose on a pair of wide , flaming wings , and came right at the prince , guided by the sound of his voice .
20 Now , the prince had never heard that Firedrakes could fly ; indeed , he had never believed in them at all , till the night before .
21 For a moment he was numb with terror ; then he flew down like a stone to the very bottom of the XXXXX , and shouted : `` Hi ! ''	hill		ashes|crescent|grammar|hill|man|sound|steam|tail|time|victims

20 `` On my sacred word of honour , '' said the beast , casually scorching an eagle that flew by into ashes .
21 The cinders fell , jingling and crackling , round the XXXXX in a little shower .	prince		answer|crescent|duck|hoofs|moon|pair|prince|sides|stone|terror

7 If he had been too warm before , the prince was too cold now .
8 The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel , and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast , which indeed it was .
9 All around were things like marble statues of men in armour : they were the dead bodies of the knights , horses and all , who had gone out of old to fight the Remora , and who had been frosted up by him .

15 It was as flat as the head of a skate-fish , it was deathly pale , and two chill-blue eyes , dead-coloured like stones , looked out of it .
16 Then there came a whisper , like the breath of the bitter east wind on a winter day : `` Where are you , and how can I come to you ? ''

1 shouted the prince .
2 Then , from a narrow chink at the bottom of the smooth , black hill , -- a chink no deeper than that under a door , but a mile wide , -- stole out a hideous head !
3 It was as flat as the head of a skate-fish , it was deathly pale , and two chill-blue eyes , dead-coloured like stones , looked out of it .
4 Then there came a whisper , like the breath of the bitter east wind on a winter day : `` Where are you , and how can I come to you ? ''
5 `` Here I am ! ''
6 said the prince from the top of the hill .
7 Then the flat , white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped , and slowly , like the movement of a sheet of ice , it slipped upwards and curled upwards , and up , and up !
8 There seemed no end to it at all ; and it moved horribly , without feet , holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill .
9 Now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth , flat , shiny coils ; and still the head was higher than the rest ; and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer , like Death .
10 The prince almost fainted : everything seemed to swim ; and in one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top , and the white head would have crawled over him , and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone .
11 And still the thing slipped up , from the chink under the mountain .
12 But the prince made a great effort ; he moved , and in two steps he was far away , down in the valley where it was not so very cold .
13 `` Hi ! ''
14 he shouted , as soon as his tongue could move within his chattering teeth .
15 There came a clear , hissing answer , like frozen words dropping round him : `` Wait till I come down .
16 What do you want ? ''
17 Then the white folds began to slide , like melting ice , from the black hill .
18 Prince Prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him , and colder in front of him .

10 It was an awul sight to behold !
11 When the Remora heard the name of the Firedrake , his hated enemy , he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley .
12 On and on and on he poured over rock and tree , as if a frozen river could slide downhill ; on and on , till there were miles of him stretching along the valley -- miles of the smooth - ribbed , icy creature , crawling and slipping forwards .
13 The green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced ; the birds fell down dead from the sky , slain by his frosty breath !
14 But , fast as the Remora stole forward , the Firedrake came quicker yet , flying and clashing his fiery wings .
15 At last they were within striking distance ; and the Firedrake , stooping from the air , dashed with his burning horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the Remora .
16 Then there rose a steam so dreadful , such a white yet fiery vapour of heat , that no one who had not the prince 's magic glass could have seen what happened .
17 With horrible grunts and roars the Firedrake tried to burn his way right through the flat body of the Remora , and to chase him to his cleft in the rock .
18 But the Remora , hissing terribly , and visibly melting away in places , yet held his ground ; and the prince could see his cold white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the Firedrake -- up and up , till they reached his knees , and the great burning beast roared like a hundred bulls with the pain .
19 Then up the Firedrake leaped , and hovering on his fiery wings , he lighted in the midst of the Remora 's back , and dashed into it with his horns .
20 But the flat , cruel head writhed backwards , and , slowly bending over on itself , the wounded Remora slid greedily to fasten again on the limbs of the Firedrake .
21 Meanwhile , the XXXXX , safe on his hill , was lunching on the loaf and the cold tongue he had brought with him .	prince		Battle|CHAPTER|answer|cleft|glass|ground|horns|midst|prince|rock

1 There came a clear , hissing answer , like frozen words dropping round him : `` Wait till I come down .
2 What do you want ? ''
3 Then the white folds began to slide , like melting ice , from the black hill .
4 Prince Prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him , and colder in front of him .
5 He looked round , and there were the trees beginning to blacken in the heat , and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the plains ; for the Firedrake was coming !
6 The prince just took time to shout , `` The Firedrake is going to pay you a visit ! ''
7 and then he soared to the top of a neighbouring hill , and looked on at what followed .

20 He hated the Remora so much , that he almost wished the Firedrake could beat it ; for the Firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair .
21 Still , he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat XXXXX of the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards , backwards , into the cleft below the hill ; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered .	body		air|body|breath|ground|head|miles|prince|river|trees|way

1 He hated the Remora so much , that he almost wished the Firedrake could beat it ; for the Firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair .
2 Still , he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards , backwards , into the cleft below the hill ; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered .
3 But the Firedrake , too , was in an unhappy way ; for his legs were now cold and black , his horns were black also , though his body , especially near the heart , glowed still like red-hot iron .
4 `` Go it , Remora ! ''
5 cried the prince : `` his legs are giving way ; he 's groggy on his pins !
6 One more effort , and he wo n't be able to move ! ''
7 Encouraged by this advice , the white , slippery Remora streamed out of his cavern again , more and more of him uncoiling , as if the mountain were quite full of him .
8 He had lost strength , no doubt : for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds , and the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter ; but so did the roars of the Firedrake .
9 Presently they sounded more like groans ; and at last the Remora slipped up his legs above the knees , and fastened on his very heart of fire .
10 Then the Firedrake stood groaning like a black bull , knee-deep in snow ; and still the Remora climbed and climbed .
11 `` Go it now , Firedrake ! ''
12 shouted the prince ; for he knew that if the Remora won , it would be too cold for him to draw near the place , and cut off the Firedrake 's head and tail .
13 `` Go it , Drake !
14 he 's slackening ! ''
15 cried the prince again ; and the brave Firedrake made one last furious effort , and rising on his wings , dropped just on the spine of his enemy .
16 The wounded Remora curled back his head again on himself , and again crawled , steaming terribly , towards his enemy .
17 But the struggle was too much for the gallant Remora .
18 The flat , cruel head moved slower ; the steam from his thousand wounds grew fiercer ; and he gently breathed his last just as the Firedrake , too , fell over and lay exhausted .
19 With one final roar , like the breath of a thousand furnaces , the Firedrake expired .
20 The prince , watching from the hill-top , could scarcely believe that these two awful scourges of Nature , which had so long devastated his country , were actually dead .
21 But when he had looked on for half-an-hour , and only a river ran where the Remora had been , while the XXXXX of the Firedrake lay stark and cold , he hurried to the spot .	body		body|bull|doubt|furnaces|mist|pair|pins|spine|steam|wounds

15 Drawing the sword of sharpness , he hacked off , at two blows , the iron head and the tail of the Firedrake .
16 They were a weary weight to carry ; but in a few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle , where he threw down his burden , and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue .
