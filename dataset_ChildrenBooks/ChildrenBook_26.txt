1 The King was grieved at the thought of losing all his faithful servants for the sake of one man , and he wished heartily that he had never set eyes on him , or that he could get rid of him .
2 But he did n't dare to send him away , for he feared he might kill him along with his people , and place himself on the throne .
3 He pondered long and deeply over the matter , and finally came to a conclusion .
4 He sent to the tailor and told him that , seeing what a great and warlike hero he was , he was about to make him an offer .
5 In a certain wood of his kingdom there dwelled two giants who did much harm ; by the way they robbed , murdered , burned , and plundered everything about them ; `` no one could approach them without endangering his life .
6 But if he could overcome and kill these two giants he should have his only daughter for a wife , and half his kingdom into the bargain ; he might have a hundred horsemen , too , to back him up . ''
7 `` That 's the very thing for a man like me , '' thought the little tailor ; `` one does n't get the offer of a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day . ''
8 `` Done with you , '' he answered ; `` I 'll soon put an end to the giants .
9 But I have n't the smallest need of your hundred horsemen ; a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not be afraid of two . ''
10 The little tailor set out , and the hundred horsemen followed him .
11 When he came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers : `` You wait here , I 'll manage the giants by myself '' ; and he went on into the wood , casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him .
12 After a while he spied the two giants lying asleep under a tree , and snoring till the very boughs bent with the breeze .
13 The little tailor lost no time in filling his wallet with stones , and then climbed up the tree under which they lay .
14 When he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a branch till he sat just above the sleepers , when he threw down one stone after the other on the nearest giant .
15 The giant felt nothing for a long time , but at last he woke up , and pinching his companion said : `` What did you strike me for ? ''
16 `` I did n't strike you , '' said the other , `` you must be dreaming . ''
17 They both lay down to sleep again , and the tailor threw down a stone on the second giant , who sprang up and cried : `` What 's that for ?

2 `` Done with you , '' he answered ; `` I 'll soon put an end to the giants .

8 When he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a branch till he sat just above the sleepers , when he threw down one stone after the other on the nearest giant .
9 The giant felt nothing for a long time , but at last he woke up , and pinching his companion said : `` What did you strike me for ? ''
10 `` I did n't strike you , '' said the other , `` you must be dreaming . ''

12 Why did you throw something at me ? ''
13 `` I did n't throw anything , '' growled the first one .
14 They wrangled on for a time , till , as both were tired , they made up the matter and fell asleep again .
15 The little tailor began his game once more , and flung the largest stone he could find in his wallet with all his force , and hit the first giant on the chest .
16 `` This is too much of a good thing ! ''
17 he yelled , and springing up like a madman , he knocked his companion against the tree till he trembled .
18 He gave , however , as good as he got , and they became so enraged that they tore up trees and beat each other with them , till they both fell dead at once on the ground .
19 Then the little tailor jumped down .
20 `` It 's a mercy , '' he said , `` that they did n't root up the tree on which I was perched , or I should have had to jump like a squirrel on to another , which , nimble though I am , would have been no easy job . ''
21 He drew his sword and gave each of the giants a very fine thrust or two on the breast , and then went to the horsemen and said : `` The deed is done , I 've put an end to the two of them ; but I assure you it has been no easy matter , for they even tore up trees in their struggle to defend themselves ; but all that 's of no use against one who slays seven XXXXX at a blow .

5 The little tailor now demanded the promised reward from the King , but he repented his promise , and pondered once more how he could rid himself of the hero .
6 `` Before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half my kingdom , '' he said to him , `` you must do another deed of valor .
7 A unicorn is running about loose in the wood , and doing much mischief ; you must first catch it . ''
8 `` I 'm even less afraid of one unicorn than of two giants ; seven at a blow , that 's my motto . ''
9 He took a piece of cord and an axe with him , went out to the wood , and again told the men who had been sent with him to remain outside .
10 He had n't to search long , for the unicorn soon passed by , and , on perceiving the tailor , dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot .
11 `` Gently , gently , '' said he , `` not so fast , my friend '' ; and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near , when he sprang lightly behind a tree ; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree , and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again , and was thus successfully captured .
12 `` Now I 've caught my bird , '' said the tailor , and he came out from behind the tree , placed the cord round its neck first , then struck the horn out of the tree with his axe , and when everything was in order led the beast before the King .
13 Still the King did n't want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand .
14 The tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood ; and he might have the huntsmen to help him .
15 `` Willingly , '' said the tailor ; `` that 's mere child 's play . ''
16 But he did n't take the huntsmen into the wood with him , and they were well enough pleased to remain behind , for the wild boar had often received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further acquaintance .
17 As soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth , and tried to knock him down ; but our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near , and got out of the window again with a jump .
18 The boar pursued him into the church , but the tailor skipped round to the door , and closed it securely .
19 So the raging beast was caught , for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window .
20 The little tailor summoned the huntsmen together , that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes .
21 Then the hero betook himself to the King , who was obliged now , whether he liked it or not , to keep his XXXXX , and hand him over his daughter and half his kingdom .	promise		bird|chapel|eyes|friend|horn|manner|mischief|motto|promise|strength

1 He had n't to search long , for the unicorn soon passed by , and , on perceiving the tailor , dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot .
2 `` Gently , gently , '' said he , `` not so fast , my friend '' ; and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near , when he sprang lightly behind a tree ; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree , and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again , and was thus successfully captured .
3 `` Now I 've caught my bird , '' said the tailor , and he came out from behind the tree , placed the cord round its neck first , then struck the horn out of the tree with his axe , and when everything was in order led the beast before the King .
4 Still the King did n't want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand .
5 The tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood ; and he might have the huntsmen to help him .
6 `` Willingly , '' said the tailor ; `` that 's mere child 's play . ''
7 But he did n't take the huntsmen into the wood with him , and they were well enough pleased to remain behind , for the wild boar had often received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further acquaintance .
8 As soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth , and tried to knock him down ; but our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near , and got out of the window again with a jump .
9 The boar pursued him into the church , but the tailor skipped round to the door , and closed it securely .
10 So the raging beast was caught , for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window .
11 The little tailor summoned the huntsmen together , that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes .
12 Then the hero betook himself to the King , who was obliged now , whether he liked it or not , to keep his promise , and hand him over his daughter and half his kingdom .
13 Had he known that no hero-warrior , but only a little tailor stood before him , it would have gone even more to his heart .
14 So the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy , and the tailor became a king .
15 After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep : `` My lad , make that waistcoat and patch these trousers , or I 'll box your ears . ''
16 Thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had been born , and next day she poured forth her woes to her father , and begged him to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor less than a tailor .
17 The King comforted her , and said : `` Leave your bedroom door open to-night , my servants shall stand outside , and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter , bind him fast , and carry him on to a ship , which shall sail away out into the wide ocean . ''
18 The Queen was well satisfied with the idea , but the armor-bearer , who had overheard everything , being much attached to his young master , went straight to him and revealed the whole plot .

6 The boar pursued him into the church , but the tailor skipped round to the door , and closed it securely .
7 So the raging beast was caught , for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring out of the window .
8 The little tailor summoned the huntsmen together , that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes .
9 Then the hero betook himself to the King , who was obliged now , whether he liked it or not , to keep his promise , and hand him over his daughter and half his kingdom .
10 Had he known that no hero-warrior , but only a little tailor stood before him , it would have gone even more to his heart .
11 So the wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy , and the tailor became a king .
12 After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep : `` My lad , make that waistcoat and patch these trousers , or I 'll box your ears . ''
13 Thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had been born , and next day she poured forth her woes to her father , and begged him to help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor less than a tailor .
14 The King comforted her , and said : `` Leave your bedroom door open to-night , my servants shall stand outside , and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter , bind him fast , and carry him on to a ship , which shall sail away out into the wide ocean . ''
15 The Queen was well satisfied with the idea , but the armor-bearer , who had overheard everything , being much attached to his young master , went straight to him and revealed the whole plot .
16 `` I 'll soon put a stop to the business , '' said the tailor .
17 That night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time ; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up , opened the door , and then lay down again .
18 The little tailor , who had only pretended to be asleep , began to call out in a clear voice : `` My lad , make that waistcoat and patch those trousers , or I 'll box your ears .
19 I have killed seven at a blow , slain two giants , led a unicorn captive , and caught a wild boar , then why should I be afraid of those men standing outside my door ? ''
20 The men , when they heard the tailor saying these words , were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by a wild army , and did n't dare go near him again .
21 So the little XXXXX was and remained a king all the days of his life .	tailor		boar|door|hand|jump|king|kingdom|master|men|patch|tailor

1 Still the King did n't want to give him the promised reward and made a third demand .
2 The tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a great deal of harm in the wood ; and he might have the huntsmen to help him .
3 `` Willingly , '' said the tailor ; `` that 's mere child 's play . ''
4 But he did n't take the huntsmen into the wood with him , and they were well enough pleased to remain behind , for the wild boar had often received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further acquaintance .

1 The King comforted her , and said : `` Leave your bedroom door open to-night , my servants shall stand outside , and when your husband is fast asleep they shall enter , bind him fast , and carry him on to a ship , which shall sail away out into the wide ocean . ''
2 The Queen was well satisfied with the idea , but the armor-bearer , who had overheard everything , being much attached to his young master , went straight to him and revealed the whole plot .
3 `` I 'll soon put a stop to the business , '' said the tailor .
4 That night he and his wife went to bed at the usual time ; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up , opened the door , and then lay down again .
5 The little tailor , who had only pretended to be asleep , began to call out in a clear voice : `` My lad , make that waistcoat and patch those trousers , or I 'll box your ears .
6 I have killed seven at a blow , slain two giants , led a unicorn captive , and caught a wild boar , then why should I be afraid of those men standing outside my door ? ''
7 The men , when they heard the tailor saying these words , were so terrified that they fled as if pursued by a wild army , and did n't dare go near him again .

9 A VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT CHAPTER I My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire , and I was the third of four sons .
10 He sent me to Cambridge at fourteen years old , and after studying there three years I was bound apprentice to Mr. Bates , a famous surgeon in London .
11 There , as my father now and then sent me small sums of money , I spent them in learning navigation , and other arts useful to those who travel , as I always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do .
12 Three years after my leaving him my good master , Mr. Bates , recommended me as ship 's surgeon to the `` Swallow , '' on which I voyaged three years .
13 When I came back I settled in London , and , having taken part of a small house , I married Miss Mary Burton , daughter of Mr. Edmund Burton , hosier .
14 But my good master Bates died two years after ; and as I had few friends my business began to fail , and I determined to go again to sea .
15 After several voyages , I accepted an offer from Captain W. Pritchard , master of the `` Antelope , '' who was making a voyage to the South Sea .
16 We set sail from Bristol , May 4 , 1699 ; and our voyage at first was very prosperous .
17 But in our passage to the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen 's Land .
18 Twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food , and the rest were in a very weak condition .
19 On the 5th of November , the weather being very hazy , the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship ; but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it , and immediately split .
20 Six of the crew , of whom I was one , letting down the boat , got clear of the ship , and we rowed about three leagues , till we could work no longer .

12 When I woke , it was just daylight .
13 I attempted to rise , but could not ; for as I happened to be lying on my back , I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side to the ground ; and my hair , which was long and thick , tied down in the same manner .

16 I heard a confused noise about me , but could see nothing except the sky .
17 In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg , which , advancing gently over my breast , came almost up to my chin , when , bending my eyes downward , I perceived it to be a human creature , not six inches high , with a bow and arrow in his hands , and a quiver at his back .
18 In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first .
19 I was in the utmost astonishment , and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright ; and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground .
20 However , they soon returned , and one of them , who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face , lifted up his hands in admiration .
21 I lay all this while in great uneasiness ; but at length , struggling to get loose , I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground ; and at the same time , with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain , I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair , so that I was just able to turn my head about two XXXXX .	inches		companions|food|fright|inches|rock|ship|something|sun|tide|wind

1 Twelve of our crew died from hard labor and bad food , and the rest were in a very weak condition .
2 On the 5th of November , the weather being very hazy , the seamen spied a rock within 120 yards of the ship ; but the wind was so strong that we were driven straight upon it , and immediately split .
3 Six of the crew , of whom I was one , letting down the boat , got clear of the ship , and we rowed about three leagues , till we could work no longer .
4 We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves ; and in about half an hour the boat was upset by a sudden squall .
5 What became of my companions in the boat , or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel , I can not tell ; but I conclude they were all lost .
6 For my part , I swam as fortune directed me , and was pushed forward by wind and tide ; but when I was able to struggle no longer I found myself within my depth .
7 By this time the storm was much abated .
8 I reached the shore at last , about eight o'clock in the evening , and advanced nearly half a mile inland , but could not discover any sign of inhabitants .

9 The sun began to grow hot , and the light hurt my eyes .
10 I heard a confused noise about me , but could see nothing except the sky .
11 In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg , which , advancing gently over my breast , came almost up to my chin , when , bending my eyes downward , I perceived it to be a human creature , not six inches high , with a bow and arrow in his hands , and a quiver at his back .
12 In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first .
13 I was in the utmost astonishment , and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright ; and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground .
14 However , they soon returned , and one of them , who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face , lifted up his hands in admiration .
15 I lay all this while in great uneasiness ; but at length , struggling to get loose , I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground ; and at the same time , with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain , I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair , so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches .
16 But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them , whereupon there was a great shout , and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand , which pricked me like so many needles .
17 Moreover , they shot another flight into the air , of which some fell on my face , which I immediately covered with my left hand .
18 When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain , and then , striving again to get loose , they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first , and some of them tried to stab me with their spears ; but by good luck I had on a leather jacket , which they could not pierce .
19 By this time I thought it most prudent to lie still till night , when , my left hand being already loose , I could easily free myself ; and as for the inhabitants , I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I saw .
20 When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows , but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased ; and about four yards from me , for more than an hour , there was a knocking , like people at work .
21 Then , turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me , I saw a stage set up , about a foot and a half from the XXXXX , with two or three ladders to mount it .	ground		arm|bow|breast|ground|head|leg|pain|people|shore|sides

1 The sun began to grow hot , and the light hurt my eyes .
2 I heard a confused noise about me , but could see nothing except the sky .
3 In a little time I felt something alive and moving on my left leg , which , advancing gently over my breast , came almost up to my chin , when , bending my eyes downward , I perceived it to be a human creature , not six inches high , with a bow and arrow in his hands , and a quiver at his back .
4 In the meantime I felt at least forty more following the first .
5 I was in the utmost astonishment , and roared so loud that they all ran back in a fright ; and some of them were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground .
6 However , they soon returned , and one of them , who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face , lifted up his hands in admiration .
7 I lay all this while in great uneasiness ; but at length , struggling to get loose , I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm to the ground ; and at the same time , with a violent pull that gave me extreme pain , I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair , so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches .
8 But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them , whereupon there was a great shout , and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand , which pricked me like so many needles .
9 Moreover , they shot another flight into the air , of which some fell on my face , which I immediately covered with my left hand .
10 When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain , and then , striving again to get loose , they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first , and some of them tried to stab me with their spears ; but by good luck I had on a leather jacket , which they could not pierce .
11 By this time I thought it most prudent to lie still till night , when , my left hand being already loose , I could easily free myself ; and as for the inhabitants , I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I saw .
12 When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows , but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased ; and about four yards from me , for more than an hour , there was a knocking , like people at work .
13 Then , turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me , I saw a stage set up , about a foot and a half from the ground , with two or three ladders to mount it .
14 From this , one of them , who seemed to be a person of quality , made me a long speech , of which I could not understand a word , though I could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me , and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness .
15 I answered in few words , but in the most submissive manner ; and , being almost famished with hunger , I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth , to signify that I wanted food .
16 He understood me very well , and , descending from the stage , commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides , on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted , and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food , which had been sent by the King 's orders when he first received tidings of me .
17 There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark .
18 I ate them two or three at a mouthful , and took three loaves at a time .
19 They supplied me as fast as they could , with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite .
20 I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink .

6 Then , turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me , I saw a stage set up , about a foot and a half from the ground , with two or three ladders to mount it .
7 From this , one of them , who seemed to be a person of quality , made me a long speech , of which I could not understand a word , though I could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me , and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness .
8 I answered in few words , but in the most submissive manner ; and , being almost famished with hunger , I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth , to signify that I wanted food .
9 He understood me very well , and , descending from the stage , commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides , on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted , and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food , which had been sent by the King 's orders when he first received tidings of me .
10 There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark .
11 I ate them two or three at a mouthful , and took three loaves at a time .
12 They supplied me as fast as they could , with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite .
13 I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink .
14 They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me , and , being a most ingenious people , they slung up one of their largest hogsheads , then rolled it toward my hand , and beat out the top .
15 I drank it off at a draught , which I might well do , for it did not hold half a pint .
16 They brought me a second hogshead , which I drank , and made signs for more ; but they had none to give me .
17 However , I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals , who ventured to mount and walk upon my body , while one of my hands was free , without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them .
18 After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty .
19 His Excellency , having mounted my right leg , advanced to my face , with about a dozen of his retinue , and spoke about ten minutes , often pointing forward , which , as I afterward found , was toward the capital city , about half a mile distant , whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed .
20 I made a sign with my hand that was loose , putting it to the other -LRB- but over his Excellency 's head , for fear of hurting him or his train -RRB- , to show that I desired my liberty .
21 He seemed to understand me well enough , for he shook his XXXXX , though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough , and very good treatment .	head		body|dozen|finger|head|inhabitants|loaves|noise|none|people|strings

1 But the creatures ran off a second time before I could seize them , whereupon there was a great shout , and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand , which pricked me like so many needles .
2 Moreover , they shot another flight into the air , of which some fell on my face , which I immediately covered with my left hand .
3 When this shower of arrows was over I groaned with grief and pain , and then , striving again to get loose , they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first , and some of them tried to stab me with their spears ; but by good luck I had on a leather jacket , which they could not pierce .

15 However , I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals , who ventured to mount and walk upon my body , while one of my hands was free , without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them .
16 After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty .
17 His Excellency , having mounted my right leg , advanced to my face , with about a dozen of his retinue , and spoke about ten minutes , often pointing forward , which , as I afterward found , was toward the capital city , about half a mile distant , whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed .
18 I made a sign with my hand that was loose , putting it to the other -LRB- but over his Excellency 's head , for fear of hurting him or his train -RRB- , to show that I desired my liberty .
19 He seemed to understand me well enough , for he shook his head , though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough , and very good treatment .
20 Then I once more thought of attempting to escape ; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands , which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased , I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased .
21 Then they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment , which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the XXXXX .	arrows		Excellency|arrows|blisters|body|enemies|head|impatience|none|pint|time

1 When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more arrows , but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased ; and about four yards from me , for more than an hour , there was a knocking , like people at work .
2 Then , turning my head that way as well as the pegs and strings would let me , I saw a stage set up , about a foot and a half from the ground , with two or three ladders to mount it .
3 From this , one of them , who seemed to be a person of quality , made me a long speech , of which I could not understand a word , though I could tell from his manner that he sometimes threatened me , and sometimes spoke with pity and kindness .
4 I answered in few words , but in the most submissive manner ; and , being almost famished with hunger , I could not help showing my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth , to signify that I wanted food .
5 He understood me very well , and , descending from the stage , commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides , on which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted , and walked toward my mouth with baskets full of food , which had been sent by the King 's orders when he first received tidings of me .
6 There were legs and shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark .
7 I ate them two or three at a mouthful , and took three loaves at a time .
8 They supplied me as fast as they could , with a thousand marks of wonder at my appetite .
9 I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink .
10 They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me , and , being a most ingenious people , they slung up one of their largest hogsheads , then rolled it toward my hand , and beat out the top .
11 I drank it off at a draught , which I might well do , for it did not hold half a pint .
12 They brought me a second hogshead , which I drank , and made signs for more ; but they had none to give me .

20 The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy , and presently I fell asleep .
21 I slept about eight hours , as I was told afterward ; and it was no wonder , for the physicians , by the Emperor 's orders , had mingled a sleeping XXXXX in the hogsheads of wine .	draught		creature|draught|drink|face|fear|mortals|none|sight|something|stage
