3 So , one fine morning , the two brothers left the hut , and walked together to the place where the great road divided .
4 There they embraced and parted , promising that if anything remarkable had happened to either , he would return to the cross roads and wait till his brother came .
5 The youth who took the path that ran eastwards arrived presently at a large city , where he found everybody standing at the doors , wringing their hands and weeping bitterly .
6 ` What is the matter ? '
7 asked he , pausing and looking round .
8 And a man replied , in a faltering voice , that each year a beautiful girl was chosen by lot to be offered up to a dreadful fiery dragon , who had a mother even worse than himself , and this year the lot had fallen on their peerless princess .
9 ` But where IS the princess ? '
10 said the young man once more , and again the man answered him : ` She is standing under a tree , a mile away , waiting for the dragon . '
11 This time the Knight of the Fish did not stop to hear more , but ran off as fast as he could , and found the princess bathed in tears , and trembling from head to foot .
12 She turned as she heard the sound of his sword , and removed her handkerchief from his eyes .
13 ` Fly , ' she cried ; ` fly while you have yet time , before that monster sees you . '
14 She said it , and she mean it ; yet , when he had turned his back , she felt more forsaken than before .
15 But in reality it was not more than a few minutes before he came back , galloping furiously on a horse he had borrowed , and carrying a huge mirror across its neck . '
16 I am in time , then , ' he cried , dismounting very carefully , and placing the mirror against the trunk of a tree .
17 ` Give me your veil , ' he said hastily to the princess .
18 And when she had unwound it from her head he covered the mirror with it .
19 ` The moment the dragon comes near you , you must tear off the veil , ' cried he ; ` and be sure you hide behind the mirror .
20 Have no fear ; I shall be at hand . '
21 He and his horse had scarcely found shelter amongst some rocks , when the flap of the XXXXX 's wings could be plainly heard .	dragon		Fish|Knight|anything|dragon|fear|hut|lot|mother|sword|trunk

18 ` It is called the castle of Albatroz , ' answered the princess .
19 ` It is enchanted , and no one that has tried to enter it has ever come back . '
20 Her husband said nothing , and began to talk of something else ; but the next morning he ordered his horse , took his spear , called his bloodhound , and set off for the castle .
21 It needed a brave XXXXX to approach it , for it made your hair stand on end merely to look at it ; it was as dark as the night of a storm , and as silent as the grave .	man		back|fury|instant|man|monster|one|palace|pieces|sun|view

1 Then , still looking the monster steadily in the face , she passed one hand behind her back and snatched off the veil , stepping swiftly behind the tree as she did so .
2 The princess had not known , when she obeyed the orders of the Knight of the Fish , what she expected to happen .
3 Would the dragon with snaky locks be turned to stone , she wondered , like the dragon in an old story her nurse had told her ; or would some fiery spark dart from the heart of the mirror , and strike him dead ?
4 Neither of these things occurred , but , instead , the dragon stopped short with surprise and rage when he saw a monster before him as big and strong as himself .
5 He shook his mane with rage and fury ; the enemy in front did exactly the same .
6 He lashed his tail , and rolled his red eyes , and the dragon opposite was no whit behind him .

2 He noticed , with amazement , that as he walked through the streets the guards drew themselves up in line , and saluted him , and the drummers played the royal march ; but he was still more bewildered when several servants in livery ran up to him and told him that the princess was sure something terrible had befallen him , and had made herself ill with weeping .
3 At last it occurred to him that once more he had been taken for his brother . '

1 They went on and on till they reached a great stone wall , many , many feet high .
2 ` Now , prince , ' said the magpie , ` the three bulrushes are behind that wall . '
3 The prince wasted no time .
4 He set his horse at the wall and leaped over it .
5 Then he looked about for the three bulrushes , pulled them up and set off with them on his way home .
6 As he rode along one of the bulrushes happened to knock against something .
7 It split open and , only think !
8 out sprang a lovely girl , who said : ` My heart 's love , you are mine and I am yours ; do give me a glass of water . '
9 But how could the prince give it her when there was no water at hand ?
10 So the lovely maiden flew away .
11 He split the second bulrush as an experiment and just the same thing happened .
12 How careful he was of the third bulrush !
13 He waited till he came to a well , and there he split it open , and out sprang a maiden seven times lovelier than either of the others , and she too said : ` My heart 's love , I am yours and you are mine ; do give me a glass of water . '
14 This time the water was ready and the girl did not fly away , but she and the prince promised to love each other always .
15 Then they set out for home .
16 They soon reached the prince 's country , and as he wished to bring his promised bride back in a fine coach he went on to the town to fetch one .
17 In the field where the well was , the king 's swineherds and cowherds were feeding their droves , and the prince left Ilonka -LRB- for that was her name -RRB- in their care .
18 Unluckily the chief swineherd had an ugly old daughter , and whilst the prince was away he dressed her up in fine clothes , and threw Ilonka into the well .

8 Her distaff turned of itself and her spindle span by itself and the flax wound itself off ; and however much she might use there was always plenty left .
9 When the queen -- or , rather , the swineherd 's daughter -- heard of this , she very much wished to have the distaff , but the girl flatly refused to give it to her .
10 However , at last she consented on condition that she might sleep one night in the king 's room .
11 The queen was very angry , and scolded her well ; but as she longed to have the distaff she consented , though she gave the king a sleeping draught at supper .

15 But the king was so sound asleep he neither heard nor spoke , and Ilonka left the room , sadly thinking he was ashamed to own her .
16 Soon after the queen again sent to say that she wanted to buy the spindle .

18 And once more Ilonka went to the king 's room and spoke to him ; whisper as sweetly as she might she could get no answer .
19 Now some of the king 's servants had taken note of the matter , and warned their master not to eat and drink anything that the queen offered him , as for two nights running she had given him a sleeping draught .
20 The queen had no idea that her doings had been discovered ; and when , a few days later , she wanted the flax , and had to pay the same price for it , she felt no fears at all .

1 However , at last she consented on condition that she might sleep one night in the king 's room .
2 The queen was very angry , and scolded her well ; but as she longed to have the distaff she consented , though she gave the king a sleeping draught at supper .
3 Then the girl went to the king 's room looking seven times lovelier than ever .
4 She bent over the sleeper and said : ` My heart 's love , I am yours and you are mine .
5 Speak to me but once ; I am your Ilonka . '
6 But the king was so sound asleep he neither heard nor spoke , and Ilonka left the room , sadly thinking he was ashamed to own her .
7 Soon after the queen again sent to say that she wanted to buy the spindle .
8 The girl agreed to let her have it on the same conditions as before ; but this time , also , the queen took care to give the king a sleeping draught .
9 And once more Ilonka went to the king 's room and spoke to him ; whisper as sweetly as she might she could get no answer .
10 Now some of the king 's servants had taken note of the matter , and warned their master not to eat and drink anything that the queen offered him , as for two nights running she had given him a sleeping draught .
11 The queen had no idea that her doings had been discovered ; and when , a few days later , she wanted the flax , and had to pay the same price for it , she felt no fears at all .
12 At supper that night the queen offered the king all sorts of nice things to eat and drink , but he declared he was not hungry , and went early to bed .
13 The queen repented bitterly her promise to the girl , but it was too late to recall it ; for Ilonka had already entered the king 's room , where he lay anxiously waiting for something , he knew not what .
14 All of a sudden he saw a lovely maiden who bent over him and said : ` My dearest love , I am yours and you are mine .
15 Speak to me , for I am your Ilonka . '
16 At these words the king 's heart bounded within him .
17 He sprang up and embraced and kissed her , and she told him all her adventures since the moment he had left her .

12 Lucky Luck Once upon a time there was a king who had an only son .
13 When the lad was about eighteen years old his father had to go to fight in a war against a neighbouring country , and the king led his troops in person .
14 He bade his son act as Regent in his absence , but ordered him on no account to marry till his return .
15 Time went by .
16 The prince ruled the country and never even thought of marrying .
17 But when he reached his twenty-fifth birthday he began to think that it might be rather nice to have a wife , and he thought so much that at last he got quite eager about it .
18 He remembered , however , what his father had said , and waited some time longer , till at last it was ten years since the king went out to war .
19 Then the prince called his courtiers about him and set off with a great retinue to seek a bride .
20 He hardly knew which way to go , so he wandered about for twenty days , when , suddenly , he found himself in his father 's camp .
21 The king was delighted to see his son , and had a great many questions to ask and answer ; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting for him at home the XXXXX was starting off to seek a wife he was very angry , and said : ` You may go where you please but I will not leave any of my people with you .

1 Now some of the king 's servants had taken note of the matter , and warned their master not to eat and drink anything that the queen offered him , as for two nights running she had given him a sleeping draught .
2 The queen had no idea that her doings had been discovered ; and when , a few days later , she wanted the flax , and had to pay the same price for it , she felt no fears at all .
3 At supper that night the queen offered the king all sorts of nice things to eat and drink , but he declared he was not hungry , and went early to bed .
4 The queen repented bitterly her promise to the girl , but it was too late to recall it ; for Ilonka had already entered the king 's room , where he lay anxiously waiting for something , he knew not what .
5 All of a sudden he saw a lovely maiden who bent over him and said : ` My dearest love , I am yours and you are mine .
6 Speak to me , for I am your Ilonka . '
7 At these words the king 's heart bounded within him .
8 He sprang up and embraced and kissed her , and she told him all her adventures since the moment he had left her .
9 And when he heard all that Ilonka had suffered , and how he had been deceived , he vowed he would be revenged ; so he gave orders that the swineherd , his wife and daughter should all be hanged ; and so they were .

12 The prince and his bride walked over the bridge , but the servant said he would ride the horses through the stream so as to water and bathe them .
13 They reached the other side without harm , and bought a new carriage in the town , which was quite near , and set off once more on their travels ; but they had not gone far when they met a messenger from the king who said to the prince : ` His Majesty has sent your Royal Highness this beautiful carriage so that you may make a fitting entry into your own country and amongst your own people . '
14 The prince was so delighted that he could not speak .
15 But the servant said : ` My lord , let me examine this carriage first and then you can get in if I find it is all right ; otherwise we had better stay in our own . '
16 The prince made no objections , and after looking the carriage well over the servant said : ` It is as bad as it is smart ' ; and with that he knocked it all to pieces , and they went on in the one that they had bought .
17 At last they reached the frontier ; there another messenger was waiting for them , who said that the king had sent two splendid robes for the prince and his bride , and begged that they would wear them for their state entry .
18 But the servant implored the prince to have nothing to do with them , and never gave him any peace till he had obtained leave to destroy the robes .
19 The old king was furious when he found that all his arts had failed ; that his son still lived and that he would have to give up the crown to him now he was married , for that was the law of the land .
20 He longed to know how the prince had escaped , and said : ` My dear son , I do indeed rejoice to have you safely back , but I can not imagine why the beautiful carriage and the splendid robes I sent did not please you ; why you had them destroyed . '
21 ` Indeed , sire , ' said the prince , ' I was myself much annoyed at their destruction ; but my XXXXX had begged to direct everything on the journey and I had promised him that he should do so .	servant		frontier|king|law|lord|luggage|messenger|pieces|rest|servant|town

1 At last the servant said : ` Gracious prince , I dreamt that if your Royal Highness would grant all I asked we should get home safe and sound ; but if you did not we should certainly be lost .
2 My dreams never deceive me , so I entreat you to follow my advice during the rest of the journey . '
3 ` Do n't make such a fuss about a dream , ' said the prince ; ` dreams are but clouds .
4 Still , to prevent your being anxious I will promise to do as you wish . '
5 With that they set out on their journey .
6 At midday they reached the Gold Stream .
7 When they got to the bridge the servant said : ` Let us leave the carriage here , my prince , and walk a little way .
8 The town is not far off and we can easily get another carriage there , for the wheels of this one are bad and will not hold out much longer . '
9 The prince looked well at the carriage .
