1 -- How Prince Prigio was deserted by Everybody MEANWHILE , Prince Prigio had to suffer many unpleasant things .
2 Though he was the crown prince -LRB- and though his arguments were unanswerable -RRB- , everybody shunned him for a coward .
3 The queen , who did not believe in Firedrakes , alone took his side .
4 He was not only avoided by all , but he had most disagreeable scenes with his own cousins , Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena .
5 In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking alone , and did not bow to him .
6 `` Dear Molly , '' said the prince , who liked her , `` how have I been so unfortunate as to offend you ? ''
7 `` My name , sir , is Lady Molinda , '' she said , very proudly ; `` and you have sent your own brother to his grave ! ''
8 -LSB- Illustration : Page 24 -RSB- `` Oh , excuse me , '' said the prince , `` I am certain he has merely gone off on his travels .
9 He 'll come back when he 's tired : there are no Firedrakes ; a French writer says they are ` purement fabuleux , purely fabulous , you know . ''

11 And was he then -- tired -- of me ? ''

2 For he was quite unendurable , the king said , and he could not trust his own temper when he thought of him .
3 And he grew so fierce , that even the queen was afraid of him now .
4 The poor queen cried a good deal ; Prigio being her favourite son , on account of his acknowledged ability and talent .
5 But the rest of the courtiers were delighted at leaving Prince Prigio behind .
6 For his part , he , very good-naturedly , showed them the best and shortest road to Falkenstein , the city where they were going ; and easily proved that neither the chief secretary for geography , nor the general of the army , knew anything about the matter -- which , indeed , they did not .
7 The ungrateful courtiers left Prigio with hoots and yells , for they disliked him so much that they forgot he would be king one day .
8 He therefore reminded them of this little fact in future history , which made them feel uncomfortable enough , and then lay down in his hammock and went to sleep .
9 When he wakened , the air was cold and the day was beginning to grow dark .
10 Prince Prigio thought he would go down and dine at a tavern in the town , for no servants had been left with him .
11 But what was his annoyance when he found that his boots , his sword , his cap , his cloak -- all his clothes , in fact , except those he wore , -- had been taken away by the courtiers , merely to spite him !
12 His wardrobe had been ransacked , and everything that had not been carried off had been cut up , burned , and destroyed .
13 Never was such a spectacle of wicked mischief .
14 It was as if hay had been made of everything he possessed .
15 What was worse , he had not a penny in his pocket to buy new things ; and his father had stopped his allowance of fifty thousand pounds a month .
16 Can you imagine anything more cruel and unjust than this conduct ?
17 for it was not the prince 's fault that he was so clever .

7 They said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurable -- that nothing was more rude than to be always in the right -- that cleverness might be carried far too far -- that it was better even to be born stupid -LRB- `` Like the rest of you , '' thought the prince -RRB- ; and , in fact , nobody had a good word for him .
8 Yes , one had !
9 It was the pretty lady of the carriage .
10 I never could tell you how pretty she was .
11 She was tall , with cheeks like white roses blushing : she had dark hair , and very large dark-grey eyes , and her face was the kindest in the world !
12 The prince first thought how nice and good she looked , even before he thought how pretty she looked .
13 She stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him .
14 She had never seen the prince , for she was but newly come to Pantouflia ; but she declared that it was his misfortune , not his fault , to be so clever .
15 `` And , then , think how hard they made him work at school !
16 Besides , '' said this kind young lady , `` I hear he is extremely handsome , and very brave ; and he has a good heart , for he was kind , I have heard , to a poor boy , and did all his examination papers for him , so that the boy passed first in everything .
17 And now he is Minister for Education , though he ca n't do a line of Greek prose ! ''
18 The prince blushed at this , for he knew his conduct had not been honourable .
19 But he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young lady , a thing he had never done in his life before , because -- he said -- `` women were so stupid ! ''
20 You see he was so clever !
21 Now , at this very moment -- when the XXXXX , all of a sudden , was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room -- an extraordinary thing happened !	prince		Education|boy|disgrace|face|gentleman|guests|hair|kind|notice|prince

6 I fancied that there was no such thing as a Firedrake : he 's not in the Natural History books ; and I thought the boys were only making fun , and would be back soon , safe and sound .

9 What was he to do , indeed ?
10 And what would you have done ?
11 Bring the horns and tail he must , or perish in the adventure .
12 Otherwise , how could he meet his lady ?
13 -- why , she would think him a mere braggart .
14 The prince sat down , and thought and thought ; and the day went on , and it was now high noon .
15 At last he jumped up and rushed into the library , a room where nobody ever went except himself and the queen .
16 There he turned the books upside down , in his haste , till he found an old one , by a French gentleman , Monsieur Cyrano de Bergerac .
17 It was an account of a voyage to the moon , in which there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known ; for few travellers have been to the moon .
18 In that book , Prince Prigio fancied he would find something he half remembered , and that would be of use to him .
19 And he did !
20 So you see that cleverness , and minding your book , have some advantages , after all .
21 For here the XXXXX learned that there is a very rare beast called a Remora , which is at least as cold as the Firedrake is hot !	prince		Illustration|Page|account|boys|fellows|moon|nobody|prince|use|voyage

7 The hill of the Remora was one solid mass of frozen steel , and the cold rushed out of it like the breath of some icy beast , which indeed it was .

19 There seemed no end to it at all ; and it moved horribly , without feet , holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill .
20 Now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth , flat shiny coils ; and still the head was higher than the rest ; and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer , like Death .

20 When the Remora heard the name of the Firedrake , his hated enemy , he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley .
21 On and on and on he poured over rock and tree , as if a frozen river could slide downhill ; on and on , till there were miles of him stretching along the XXXXX -- miles of the smooth-ribbed , icy creature , crawling and slipping forwards .	valley		air|coils|everything|front|ice|side|speed|top|valley|visit

2 Then the flat , white head set itself against the edge of the chink from which it had peeped , and slowly , like the movement of a sheet of ice , it slipped upwards and curled upwards , and up , and up !
3 There seemed no end to it at all ; and it moved horribly , without feet , holding on by its own frost to the slippery side of the frozen hill .
4 Now all the lower part of the black hill was covered with the horrid white thing coiled about it in smooth , flat shiny coils ; and still the head was higher than the rest ; and still the icy cold came nearer and nearer , like Death .
5 The prince almost fainted : everything seemed to swim ; and in one moment more he would have fallen stiff on the mountain-top , and the white head would have crawled over him , and the cold coils would have slipped over him and turned him to stone .
6 And still the thing slipped up , from the chink under the mountain .
7 But the prince made a great effort ; he moved , and in two steps he was far away , down in the valley where it was not so very cold .
8 `` Hi ! ''
9 he shouted , as soon as his tongue could move within his chattering teeth .
10 There came a clear , hissing answer , like frozen words dropping round him : `` Wait till I come down .
11 What do you want ? ''
12 Then the white folds began to slide , like melting ice , from the black hill .
13 Prince Prigio felt the air getting warmer behind him , and colder in front of him .
14 He looked round , and there were the trees beginning to blacken in the heat , and the grass looking like a sea of fire along the plains ; for the Firedrake was coming !
15 The prince just took time to shout , `` The Firedrake is going to pay you a visit ! ''
16 and then he soared to the top of a neighbouring hill , and looked on at what followed .
