3 SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it , in which grew two rose trees , one bearing white roses and the other red .
4 She had two children , who were just like the two rose trees ; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red , and they were the sweetest and best children in the world , always diligent and always cheerful ; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red .
5 Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows , and to pick flowers and catch butterflies ; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household , or read aloud to her when there was no work to do .
6 The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand whenever they went out together , and when Snow-white said , `` We will never desert each other , '' Rose-red answered : `` No , not as long as we live '' ; and the mother added : `` Whatever one gets she shall share with the other . ''
7 They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them ; on the contrary , they came up to them in the most confiding manner ; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands , the deer grazed beside them , the stag would bound past them merrily , and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might .
8 No evil ever befell them ; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them , they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning , and their mother knew they were quite safe , and never felt anxious about them .
9 Once , when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun , they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place .
10 The figure got up , looked at them kindly , but said nothing , and vanished into the wood .
11 And when they looked round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a precipice , over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness .
12 And when they told their mother of their adventure , she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children .
13 Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother 's cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it .
14 In summer Rose-red looked after the house , and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed , from each tree a rose .
15 In winter Snow-white lit the fire and put on the kettle , which was made of brass , but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold .
16 In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said : `` Snow-white , go and close the shutters , '' and they drew round the fire , while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span .
17 Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb , and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings .
18 One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance .
19 The mother said : `` Rose-red , open the door quickly ; it must be some traveler seeking shelter . ''
20 Rose-red hastened to unbar the door , and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside ; but it was no such thing , only a bear , who poked his thick black head through the door .
21 Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror , the lamb began to bleat , the dove flapped its XXXXX , and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother 's bed .	wings		admittance|children|fields|figure|flowers|robe|shutters|steps|wings|work

13 Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror , the lamb began to bleat , the dove flapped its wings , and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother 's bed .

15 I am half frozen , and only wish to warm myself a little . ''

18 So they both came out of their hiding-places , and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too , and they all forgot their fear .

4 So they both came out of their hiding-places , and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too , and they all forgot their fear .
5 The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur , and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry .
6 Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire , and growled quite happily and comfortably .
7 The children soon grew quite at their ease with him , and led their helpless guest a fearful life .
8 They tugged his fur with their hands , put their small feet on his back , and rolled him about here and there , or took a hazel wand and beat him with it ; and if he growled they only laughed .
9 The bear submitted to everything with the best possible good-nature , only when they went too far he cried : `` Oh !

13 As soon as day dawned the children led him out , and he trotted over the snow into the wood .
14 From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour , and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him ; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance .
15 When spring came , and all outside was green , the bear said one morning to Snow-white : `` Now I must go away , and not return again the whole summer . ''
16 `` Where are you going to , dear bear ? ''
17 asked Snow-white .
18 `` I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs .

''
20 Snow-white was quite sad over their friend 's departure , and when she unbarred the door for him , the bear , stepping out , caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker , and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it , but she could n't be certain of it ; and the bear ran hastily away , and soon disappeared behind the trees .

10 Snow-white was quite sad over their friend 's departure , and when she unbarred the door for him , the bear , stepping out , caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker , and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it , but she could n't be certain of it ; and the bear ran hastily away , and soon disappeared behind the trees .
11 A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots .

14 The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree , and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain , and did n't seem to know what he was to do .
15 He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes , and screamed out : `` What are you standing there for ?

3 As soon as day dawned the children led him out , and he trotted over the snow into the wood .
4 From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour , and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him ; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance .

8 THE GOOSE-GIRL Once upon a time an old queen , whose husband had been dead for many years , had a beautiful daughter .
9 When she grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off .
10 Now , when the time drew near for her to be married and to depart into a foreign kingdom , her old mother gave her much costly baggage , and many ornaments , gold and silver , trinkets and knicknacks , and , in fact , everything that belonged to a royal trousseau , for she loved her daughter very dearly .

18 As she drank she murmured : `` Oh !
