1 The Sultan did not make them wait long for him , and as soon as he arrived Prince Houssain , as the eldest , took his bow and arrow and shot first ; Prince Ali shot next , and much beyond him ; and Prince Ahmed last of all , but it so happened that nobody could see where his arrow fell ; and , notwithstanding all the diligence that was used by himself and everybody else , it was not to be found far or near .
2 And though it was believed that he shot the farthest , and that he therefore deserved the Princess Nouronnihar , it was , however , necessary that his arrow should be found to make the matter more evident and certain ; and , notwithstanding his remonstrance , the Sultan judged in favor of Prince Ali , and gave orders for preparations to be made for the wedding , which was celebrated a few days after with great magnificence .
3 Prince Houssain would not honor the feast with his presence .
4 In short , his grief was so violent and insupportable that he left the Court , and renounced all right of succession to the crown , to turn hermit .
5 Prince Ahmed , too , did not come to Prince Ali 's and the Princess Nouronnihar 's wedding any more than his brother Houssain , but did not renounce the world as he had done .
6 But , as he could not imagine what had become of his arrow , he stole away from his attendants and resolved to search after it , that he might not have anything to reproach himself with .
7 With this intent he went to the place where the Princes Houssain 's and Ali 's were gathered up , and , going straight forward from there , looking carefully on both sides of him , he went so far that at last he began to think his labor was all in vain ; but yet he could not help going forward till he came to some steep craggy rocks , which were bounds to his journey , and were situated in a barren country , about four leagues distant from where he set out .
8 II When Prince Ahmed came pretty nigh to these rocks he perceived an arrow , which he gathered up , looked earnestly at it , and was in the greatest astonishment to find it was the same he shot away .
9 `` Certainly , '' said he to himself , `` neither I nor any man living could shoot an arrow so far , '' and , finding it laid flat , not sticking into the ground , he judged that it rebounded against the rock .
10 `` There must be some mystery in this , '' said he to himself again , `` and it may be advantageous to me .
11 Perhaps fortune , to make me amends for depriving me of what I thought the greatest happiness , may have reserved a greater blessing for my comfort . ''
12 As these rocks were full of caves and some of those caves were deep , the Prince entered into one , and , looking about , cast his eyes on an iron door , which seemed to have no lock , but he feared it was fastened .
13 However , thrusting against it , it opened , and discovered an easy descent , but no steps , which he walked down with his arrow in his hand .
14 At first he thought he was going into a dark , obscure place , but presently a quite different light succeeded that which he came out of , and , entering into a large , spacious place , at about fifty or sixty paces distant , he perceived a magnificent palace , which he had not then time enough to look at .
15 At the same time a lady of majestic port and air advanced as far as the porch , attended by a large troop of ladies , so finely dressed and beautiful that it was difficult to distinguish which was the mistress .

1 II When Prince Ahmed came pretty nigh to these rocks he perceived an arrow , which he gathered up , looked earnestly at it , and was in the greatest astonishment to find it was the same he shot away .
2 `` Certainly , '' said he to himself , `` neither I nor any man living could shoot an arrow so far , '' and , finding it laid flat , not sticking into the ground , he judged that it rebounded against the rock .
3 `` There must be some mystery in this , '' said he to himself again , `` and it may be advantageous to me .

7 At first he thought he was going into a dark , obscure place , but presently a quite different light succeeded that which he came out of , and , entering into a large , spacious place , at about fifty or sixty paces distant , he perceived a magnificent palace , which he had not then time enough to look at .
8 At the same time a lady of majestic port and air advanced as far as the porch , attended by a large troop of ladies , so finely dressed and beautiful that it was difficult to distinguish which was the mistress .
9 As soon as Prince Ahmed perceived the lady , he made all imaginable haste to go and pay his respects ; and the lady , on her part , seeing him coming , prevented him from addressing his discourse to her first , but said to him : `` Come nearer , Prince Ahmed , you are welcome . ''
10 It was no small surprise to the Prince to hear himself named in a place he had never heard of , though so nigh to his father 's capital , and he could not comprehend how he should be known to a lady who was a stranger to him .
11 At last he returned the lady 's compliment by throwing himself at her feet , and , rising up again , said to her : `` Madam , I return you a thousand thanks for the assurance you give me of a welcome to a place where I believed my imprudent curiosity had made me penetrate too far .

13 The Sultan of the Indies pressed Prince Ahmed no more , but said to him : `` Son , I penetrate no farther into your secrets , but leave you at your liberty ; but can tell you that you could not do me a greater pleasure than to come , and by your presence restore to me the joy I have not felt this long time , and that you shall always be welcome when you come , without interrupting your business or pleasure . ''
14 Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at the Sultan his father 's Court , and the fourth returned to the Fairy Paribanou , who did not expect him so soon .
15 A month after Prince Ahmed 's return from paying a visit to his father , as the Fairy Paribanou had observed that the Prince , since the time that he gave her an account of his journey , his discourse with his father , and the leave he asked to go and see him often , had never talked of the Sultan , as if there had been no such person in the world , whereas before he was always speaking of him , she thought he forebore on her account ; therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day : `` Prince , tell me , have you forgot the Sultan your father ?
16 Do n't you remember the promise you made to go and see him often ?
17 For my part I have not forgot what you told me at your return , and so put you in mind of it , that you may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise . ''
18 So Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as before , but much finer , and himself more magnificently mounted , equipped , and dressed , and was received by the Sultan with the same joy and satisfaction .
19 For several months he constantly paid his visits , always in a richer and finer equipage .
20 At last some viziers , the Sultan 's favorites , who judged of Prince Ahmed 's grandeur and power by the figure he cut , made the Sultan jealous of his son , saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into the people 's favor and dethrone him .
21 The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them : `` You are mistaken ; my XXXXX loves me , and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity , as I have given him no reason to be disgusted .

3 She appointed twenty gentlemen , well mounted and equipped , to attend him .

5 Then his horse , which was most finely caparisoned , and was as beautiful a creature as any in the Sultan of Indies ' stables , was led to him , and he mounted him with an extraordinary grace ; and , after he had bid her a last adieu , set forward on his journey .
6 As it was not a great way to his father 's capital , Prince Ahmed soon arrived there .
7 The people , glad to see him again , received him with acclamations of joy , and followed him in crowds to the Sultan 's apartment .
8 The Sultan received and embraced him with great joy , complaining at the same time , with a fatherly tenderness , of the affliction his long absence had been to him , which he said was the more grievous for that , fortune having decided in favor of Prince Ali his brother , he was afraid he might have committed some rash action .
9 The Prince told a story of his adventures without speaking of the Fairy , whom he said that he must not mention , and ended : `` The only favor I ask of your Majesty is to give me leave to come often and pay you my respects , and to know how you do . ''
10 `` Son , '' answered the Sultan of the Indies , `` I can not refuse you the leave you ask me ; but I should much rather you would resolve to stay with me ; at least tell me where I may send to you if you should fail to come , or when I may think your presence necessary . ''
11 `` Sir , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` what your Majesty asks of me is part of the mystery I spoke to your Majesty of .

18 At last some viziers , the Sultan 's favorites , who judged of Prince Ahmed 's grandeur and power by the figure he cut , made the Sultan jealous of his son , saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into the people 's favor and dethrone him .
19 The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them : `` You are mistaken ; my son loves me , and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity , as I have given him no reason to be disgusted . ''
20 But the favorites went on abusing Prince Ahmed till the Sultan said : `` Be it as it will , I do n't believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me he is ; how ever , I am obliged to you for your good advice , and do n't dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions . ''
21 The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his XXXXX ; which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier .	mind		Fairy|Majesty|absence|affliction|crowds|design|figure|mind|morning|power

1 When all was ready Prince Ahmed took his leave of the Fairy , embraced her , and renewed his promise to return soon .
2 Then his horse , which was most finely caparisoned , and was as beautiful a creature as any in the Sultan of Indies ' stables , was led to him , and he mounted him with an extraordinary grace ; and , after he had bid her a last adieu , set forward on his journey .
3 As it was not a great way to his father 's capital , Prince Ahmed soon arrived there .
4 The people , glad to see him again , received him with acclamations of joy , and followed him in crowds to the Sultan 's apartment .
5 The Sultan received and embraced him with great joy , complaining at the same time , with a fatherly tenderness , of the affliction his long absence had been to him , which he said was the more grievous for that , fortune having decided in favor of Prince Ali his brother , he was afraid he might have committed some rash action .
6 The Prince told a story of his adventures without speaking of the Fairy , whom he said that he must not mention , and ended : `` The only favor I ask of your Majesty is to give me leave to come often and pay you my respects , and to know how you do . ''
7 `` Son , '' answered the Sultan of the Indies , `` I can not refuse you the leave you ask me ; but I should much rather you would resolve to stay with me ; at least tell me where I may send to you if you should fail to come , or when I may think your presence necessary . ''
8 `` Sir , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` what your Majesty asks of me is part of the mystery I spoke to your Majesty of .
9 I beg of you to give me leave to remain silent on this head , for I shall come so frequently that I am afraid that I shall sooner be thought troublesome than be accused of negligence in my duty . ''
10 The Sultan of the Indies pressed Prince Ahmed no more , but said to him : `` Son , I penetrate no farther into your secrets , but leave you at your liberty ; but can tell you that you could not do me a greater pleasure than to come , and by your presence restore to me the joy I have not felt this long time , and that you shall always be welcome when you come , without interrupting your business or pleasure . ''
11 Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at the Sultan his father 's Court , and the fourth returned to the Fairy Paribanou , who did not expect him so soon .
12 A month after Prince Ahmed 's return from paying a visit to his father , as the Fairy Paribanou had observed that the Prince , since the time that he gave her an account of his journey , his discourse with his father , and the leave he asked to go and see him often , had never talked of the Sultan , as if there had been no such person in the world , whereas before he was always speaking of him , she thought he forebore on her account ; therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day : `` Prince , tell me , have you forgot the Sultan your father ?
13 Do n't you remember the promise you made to go and see him often ?
14 For my part I have not forgot what you told me at your return , and so put you in mind of it , that you may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise . ''

21 The XXXXX , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants .	magician		Sir|attendance|duty|father|finer|magician|nobody|power|visit|visits

1 The Prince told a story of his adventures without speaking of the Fairy , whom he said that he must not mention , and ended : `` The only favor I ask of your Majesty is to give me leave to come often and pay you my respects , and to know how you do . ''
2 `` Son , '' answered the Sultan of the Indies , `` I can not refuse you the leave you ask me ; but I should much rather you would resolve to stay with me ; at least tell me where I may send to you if you should fail to come , or when I may think your presence necessary . ''
3 `` Sir , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` what your Majesty asks of me is part of the mystery I spoke to your Majesty of .
4 I beg of you to give me leave to remain silent on this head , for I shall come so frequently that I am afraid that I shall sooner be thought troublesome than be accused of negligence in my duty . ''
5 The Sultan of the Indies pressed Prince Ahmed no more , but said to him : `` Son , I penetrate no farther into your secrets , but leave you at your liberty ; but can tell you that you could not do me a greater pleasure than to come , and by your presence restore to me the joy I have not felt this long time , and that you shall always be welcome when you come , without interrupting your business or pleasure . ''
6 Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at the Sultan his father 's Court , and the fourth returned to the Fairy Paribanou , who did not expect him so soon .
7 A month after Prince Ahmed 's return from paying a visit to his father , as the Fairy Paribanou had observed that the Prince , since the time that he gave her an account of his journey , his discourse with his father , and the leave he asked to go and see him often , had never talked of the Sultan , as if there had been no such person in the world , whereas before he was always speaking of him , she thought he forebore on her account ; therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day : `` Prince , tell me , have you forgot the Sultan your father ?
8 Do n't you remember the promise you made to go and see him often ?
9 For my part I have not forgot what you told me at your return , and so put you in mind of it , that you may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise . ''
10 So Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as before , but much finer , and himself more magnificently mounted , equipped , and dressed , and was received by the Sultan with the same joy and satisfaction .
11 For several months he constantly paid his visits , always in a richer and finer equipage .
12 At last some viziers , the Sultan 's favorites , who judged of Prince Ahmed 's grandeur and power by the figure he cut , made the Sultan jealous of his son , saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into the people 's favor and dethrone him .
13 The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them : `` You are mistaken ; my son loves me , and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity , as I have given him no reason to be disgusted . ''
14 But the favorites went on abusing Prince Ahmed till the Sultan said : `` Be it as it will , I do n't believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me he is ; how ever , I am obliged to you for your good advice , and do n't dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions . ''
15 The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his mind ; which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier .
16 So he sent for a female magician , who was introduced by a back door into his apartment .
17 `` Go immediately , '' he said , `` and follow my son , and watch him so well as to find out where he retires , and bring me word . ''
18 The magician left the Sultan , and , knowing the place where Prince Ahmed found his arrow , went immediately thither , and hid herself near the rocks , so that nobody could see her .
19 The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak , without taking leave either of the Sultan or any of his Court , according to custom .
20 The magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants .
21 As the XXXXX were very steep and craggy , they were an insurmountable barrier , so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it : either that the Prince retired into some cavern , or an abode of genies or fairies .	rocks		Fairy|dispute|fidelity|people|person|power|presence|rocks|story|world

3 A month after Prince Ahmed 's return from paying a visit to his father , as the Fairy Paribanou had observed that the Prince , since the time that he gave her an account of his journey , his discourse with his father , and the leave he asked to go and see him often , had never talked of the Sultan , as if there had been no such person in the world , whereas before he was always speaking of him , she thought he forebore on her account ; therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day : `` Prince , tell me , have you forgot the Sultan your father ?
4 Do n't you remember the promise you made to go and see him often ?
5 For my part I have not forgot what you told me at your return , and so put you in mind of it , that you may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise . ''
6 So Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as before , but much finer , and himself more magnificently mounted , equipped , and dressed , and was received by the Sultan with the same joy and satisfaction .
7 For several months he constantly paid his visits , always in a richer and finer equipage .
8 At last some viziers , the Sultan 's favorites , who judged of Prince Ahmed 's grandeur and power by the figure he cut , made the Sultan jealous of his son , saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into the people 's favor and dethrone him .
9 The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them : `` You are mistaken ; my son loves me , and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity , as I have given him no reason to be disgusted . ''
10 But the favorites went on abusing Prince Ahmed till the Sultan said : `` Be it as it will , I do n't believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me he is ; how ever , I am obliged to you for your good advice , and do n't dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions . ''
11 The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his mind ; which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier .
12 So he sent for a female magician , who was introduced by a back door into his apartment .
13 `` Go immediately , '' he said , `` and follow my son , and watch him so well as to find out where he retires , and bring me word . ''
14 The magician left the Sultan , and , knowing the place where Prince Ahmed found his arrow , went immediately thither , and hid herself near the rocks , so that nobody could see her .
15 The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak , without taking leave either of the Sultan or any of his Court , according to custom .
16 The magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants .
17 As the rocks were very steep and craggy , they were an insurmountable barrier , so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it : either that the Prince retired into some cavern , or an abode of genies or fairies .
18 Thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way , which she traced till she came to the farther end , looking carefully about on all sides ; but , notwithstanding all her diligence , could perceive no opening , not so much as the iron gate which Prince Ahmed discovered , which was to be seen and opened to none but men , and only to such whose presence was agreeable to the Fairy Paribanou .
19 The magician , who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther , was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made , and returned to give the Sultan an account .
20 The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician 's conduct , and said to her : `` Do you as you think fit ; I 'll wait patiently the event of your promises , '' and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value .
21 As Prince Ahmed had obtained the Fairy Paribanou 's XXXXX to go to the Sultan of the Indies ' Court once a month , he never failed , and the magician , knowing the time , went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she lost sight of the Prince and his attendants , and waited there .	leave		cavern|design|diamond|dispute|finer|impressions|journey|leave|secrets|world

1 The Sultan of the Indies pressed Prince Ahmed no more , but said to him : `` Son , I penetrate no farther into your secrets , but leave you at your liberty ; but can tell you that you could not do me a greater pleasure than to come , and by your presence restore to me the joy I have not felt this long time , and that you shall always be welcome when you come , without interrupting your business or pleasure .

5 But the favorites went on abusing Prince Ahmed till the Sultan said : `` Be it as it will , I do n't believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me he is ; how ever , I am obliged to you for your good advice , and do n't dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions . ''
6 The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his mind ; which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier .
7 So he sent for a female magician , who was introduced by a back door into his apartment .
8 `` Go immediately , '' he said , `` and follow my son , and watch him so well as to find out where he retires , and bring me word . ''
9 The magician left the Sultan , and , knowing the place where Prince Ahmed found his arrow , went immediately thither , and hid herself near the rocks , so that nobody could see her .
10 The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak , without taking leave either of the Sultan or any of his Court , according to custom .
11 The magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants .
12 As the rocks were very steep and craggy , they were an insurmountable barrier , so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it : either that the Prince retired into some cavern , or an abode of genies or fairies .
13 Thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way , which she traced till she came to the farther end , looking carefully about on all sides ; but , notwithstanding all her diligence , could perceive no opening , not so much as the iron gate which Prince Ahmed discovered , which was to be seen and opened to none but men , and only to such whose presence was agreeable to the Fairy Paribanou .
14 The magician , who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther , was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made , and returned to give the Sultan an account .
15 The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician 's conduct , and said to her : `` Do you as you think fit ; I 'll wait patiently the event of your promises , '' and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value .
16 As Prince Ahmed had obtained the Fairy Paribanou 's leave to go to the Sultan of the Indies ' Court once a month , he never failed , and the magician , knowing the time , went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she lost sight of the Prince and his attendants , and waited there .
17 The next morning Prince Ahmed went out , as usual , at the iron gate , with the same attendants as before , and passed by the magician , whom he knew not to be such , and , seeing her lie with her head against the rock , and complaining as if she were in great pain , he pitied her , turned his horse about , went to her , and asked her what was the matter with her , and what he could do to ease her .
18 The artful sorceress looked at the Prince in a pitiful manner , without ever lifting up her head , and answered in broken words and sighs , as if she could hardly fetch her breath , that she was going to the capital city , but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that her strength failed her , and she was forced to lie down where he saw her , far from any habitation , and without any hopes of assistance .
19 `` Good woman , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` you are not so far from help as you imagine .
20 I am ready to assist you , and convey you where you will meet with a speedy cure ; only get up , and let one of my people take you behind him . ''
21 At these XXXXX the magician , who pretended sickness only to know where the Prince lived and what he did , refused not the charitable offer he made her , and that her actions might correspond with her words she made many pretended vain endeavors to get up .	words		arrow|discourse|favorites|magician|morning|nobody|promises|rocks|tenderness|words

1 So Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as before , but much finer , and himself more magnificently mounted , equipped , and dressed , and was received by the Sultan with the same joy and satisfaction .
2 For several months he constantly paid his visits , always in a richer and finer equipage .

5 `` Go immediately , '' he said , `` and follow my son , and watch him so well as to find out where he retires , and bring me word . ''
6 The magician left the Sultan , and , knowing the place where Prince Ahmed found his arrow , went immediately thither , and hid herself near the rocks , so that nobody could see her .
7 The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak , without taking leave either of the Sultan or any of his Court , according to custom .
8 The magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants .
9 As the rocks were very steep and craggy , they were an insurmountable barrier , so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it : either that the Prince retired into some cavern , or an abode of genies or fairies .
10 Thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way , which she traced till she came to the farther end , looking carefully about on all sides ; but , notwithstanding all her diligence , could perceive no opening , not so much as the iron gate which Prince Ahmed discovered , which was to be seen and opened to none but men , and only to such whose presence was agreeable to the Fairy Paribanou .
11 The magician , who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther , was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made , and returned to give the Sultan an account .
12 The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician 's conduct , and said to her : `` Do you as you think fit ; I 'll wait patiently the event of your promises , '' and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value .
13 As Prince Ahmed had obtained the Fairy Paribanou 's leave to go to the Sultan of the Indies ' Court once a month , he never failed , and the magician , knowing the time , went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she lost sight of the Prince and his attendants , and waited there .
14 The next morning Prince Ahmed went out , as usual , at the iron gate , with the same attendants as before , and passed by the magician , whom he knew not to be such , and , seeing her lie with her head against the rock , and complaining as if she were in great pain , he pitied her , turned his horse about , went to her , and asked her what was the matter with her , and what he could do to ease her .
15 The artful sorceress looked at the Prince in a pitiful manner , without ever lifting up her head , and answered in broken words and sighs , as if she could hardly fetch her breath , that she was going to the capital city , but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that her strength failed her , and she was forced to lie down where he saw her , far from any habitation , and without any hopes of assistance .
16 `` Good woman , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` you are not so far from help as you imagine .
17 I am ready to assist you , and convey you where you will meet with a speedy cure ; only get up , and let one of my people take you behind him . ''
18 At these words the magician , who pretended sickness only to know where the Prince lived and what he did , refused not the charitable offer he made her , and that her actions might correspond with her words she made many pretended vain endeavors to get up .
19 At the same time two of the Prince 's attendants , alighting off their horses , helped her up , and set her behind another , and mounted their horses again , and followed the Prince , who turned back to the iron gate , which was opened by one of his retinue who rode before .
20 And when he came into the outward court of the Fairy , without dismounting himself , he sent to tell her he wanted to speak with her .
21 The Fairy Paribanou came with all imaginable haste , not knowing what made Prince Ahmed return so soon , who , not giving her XXXXX to ask him the reason , said : `` Princess , I desire you would have compassion on this good woman , '' pointing to the magician , who was held up by two of his retinue .	time		abode|apartment|attendants|horses|nobody|sickness|sides|time|woman|word

1 The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make him believe that he said to them : `` You are mistaken ; my son loves me , and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity , as I have given him no reason to be disgusted . ''
2 But the favorites went on abusing Prince Ahmed till the Sultan said : `` Be it as it will , I do n't believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me he is ; how ever , I am obliged to you for your good advice , and do n't dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions . ''

5 The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak , without taking leave either of the Sultan or any of his Court , according to custom .
6 The magician , seeing him coming , followed him with her eyes , till on a sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants .
7 As the rocks were very steep and craggy , they were an insurmountable barrier , so that the magician judged that there were but two things for it : either that the Prince retired into some cavern , or an abode of genies or fairies .
8 Thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid and went directly to the hollow way , which she traced till she came to the farther end , looking carefully about on all sides ; but , notwithstanding all her diligence , could perceive no opening , not so much as the iron gate which Prince Ahmed discovered , which was to be seen and opened to none but men , and only to such whose presence was agreeable to the Fairy Paribanou .
9 The magician , who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther , was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made , and returned to give the Sultan an account .
10 The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician 's conduct , and said to her : `` Do you as you think fit ; I 'll wait patiently the event of your promises , '' and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value .
11 As Prince Ahmed had obtained the Fairy Paribanou 's leave to go to the Sultan of the Indies ' Court once a month , he never failed , and the magician , knowing the time , went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she lost sight of the Prince and his attendants , and waited there .
12 The next morning Prince Ahmed went out , as usual , at the iron gate , with the same attendants as before , and passed by the magician , whom he knew not to be such , and , seeing her lie with her head against the rock , and complaining as if she were in great pain , he pitied her , turned his horse about , went to her , and asked her what was the matter with her , and what he could do to ease her .
13 The artful sorceress looked at the Prince in a pitiful manner , without ever lifting up her head , and answered in broken words and sighs , as if she could hardly fetch her breath , that she was going to the capital city , but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that her strength failed her , and she was forced to lie down where he saw her , far from any habitation , and without any hopes of assistance .
14 `` Good woman , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` you are not so far from help as you imagine .
15 I am ready to assist you , and convey you where you will meet with a speedy cure ; only get up , and let one of my people take you behind him . ''
16 At these words the magician , who pretended sickness only to know where the Prince lived and what he did , refused not the charitable offer he made her , and that her actions might correspond with her words she made many pretended vain endeavors to get up .
17 At the same time two of the Prince 's attendants , alighting off their horses , helped her up , and set her behind another , and mounted their horses again , and followed the Prince , who turned back to the iron gate , which was opened by one of his retinue who rode before .
18 And when he came into the outward court of the Fairy , without dismounting himself , he sent to tell her he wanted to speak with her .
19 The Fairy Paribanou came with all imaginable haste , not knowing what made Prince Ahmed return so soon , who , not giving her time to ask him the reason , said : `` Princess , I desire you would have compassion on this good woman , '' pointing to the magician , who was held up by two of his retinue .
20 `` I found her in the condition you see her in , and promised her the assistance she stands in need of , and am persuaded that you , out of your own goodness , as well as upon my entreaty , will not abandon her . ''
21 The Fairy Paribanou , who had her eyes fixed upon the pretended sick woman all the XXXXX that the Prince was talking to her , ordered two of her women who followed her to take her from the two men that held her , and carry her into an apartment of the palace , and take as much care of her as she would herself .	time		Fairy|apartment|diligence|foot|goodness|need|offer|place|time|words

1 The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the impressions their discourse had made on his mind ; which had so alarmed him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand vizier .
2 So he sent for a female magician , who was introduced by a back door into his apartment .

2 The magician , who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther , was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made , and returned to give the Sultan an account .
3 The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician 's conduct , and said to her : `` Do you as you think fit ; I 'll wait patiently the event of your promises , '' and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great value .
4 As Prince Ahmed had obtained the Fairy Paribanou 's leave to go to the Sultan of the Indies ' Court once a month , he never failed , and the magician , knowing the time , went a day or two before to the foot of the rock where she lost sight of the Prince and his attendants , and waited there .
5 The next morning Prince Ahmed went out , as usual , at the iron gate , with the same attendants as before , and passed by the magician , whom he knew not to be such , and , seeing her lie with her head against the rock , and complaining as if she were in great pain , he pitied her , turned his horse about , went to her , and asked her what was the matter with her , and what he could do to ease her .
6 The artful sorceress looked at the Prince in a pitiful manner , without ever lifting up her head , and answered in broken words and sighs , as if she could hardly fetch her breath , that she was going to the capital city , but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that her strength failed her , and she was forced to lie down where he saw her , far from any habitation , and without any hopes of assistance .
7 `` Good woman , '' replied Prince Ahmed , `` you are not so far from help as you imagine .

9 At these words the magician , who pretended sickness only to know where the Prince lived and what he did , refused not the charitable offer he made her , and that her actions might correspond with her words she made many pretended vain endeavors to get up .
10 At the same time two of the Prince 's attendants , alighting off their horses , helped her up , and set her behind another , and mounted their horses again , and followed the Prince , who turned back to the iron gate , which was opened by one of his retinue who rode before .
11 And when he came into the outward court of the Fairy , without dismounting himself , he sent to tell her he wanted to speak with her .
12 The Fairy Paribanou came with all imaginable haste , not knowing what made Prince Ahmed return so soon , who , not giving her time to ask him the reason , said : `` Princess , I desire you would have compassion on this good woman , '' pointing to the magician , who was held up by two of his retinue .
13 `` I found her in the condition you see her in , and promised her the assistance she stands in need of , and am persuaded that you , out of your own goodness , as well as upon my entreaty , will not abandon her . ''
14 The Fairy Paribanou , who had her eyes fixed upon the pretended sick woman all the time that the Prince was talking to her , ordered two of her women who followed her to take her from the two men that held her , and carry her into an apartment of the palace , and take as much care of her as she would herself .
15 While the two women executed the Fairy 's commands , she went up to Prince Ahmed , and , whispering in his ear , said : `` Prince , this woman is not so sick as she pretends to be ; and I am very much mistaken if she is not an impostor , who will be the cause of a great trouble to you .
16 But do n't be concerned , let what will be devised against you ; be persuaded that I will deliver you out of all the snares that shall be laid for you .
17 Go and pursue your journey . ''
18 This discourse of the Fairy 's did not in the least frighten Prince Ahmed .
19 `` My Princess , '' said he , `` as I do not remember I ever did or designed anybody an injury , I can not believe anybody can have a thought of doing me one , but if they have I shall not , nevertheless , forbear doing good whenever I have an opportunity . ''

20 The two women , who were fairies as well as their mistress , after they had told the magician how glad they were that she was cured so soon , walked before her , and conducted her through several apartments , all more noble than that wherein she lay , into a large hall , the most richly and magnificently furnished of all the palace .

1 The Fairy Paribanou , who had her eyes fixed upon the pretended sick woman all the time that the Prince was talking to her , ordered two of her women who followed her to take her from the two men that held her , and carry her into an apartment of the palace , and take as much care of her as she would herself .
2 While the two women executed the Fairy 's commands , she went up to Prince Ahmed , and , whispering in his ear , said : `` Prince , this woman is not so sick as she pretends to be ; and I am very much mistaken if she is not an impostor , who will be the cause of a great trouble to you .

8 In the meantime the two women carried the magician into a very fine apartment , richly furnished .

10 When they had put her into bed -LRB- for the old sorceress pretended that her fever was so violent she could not help herself in the least -RRB- one of the women went out , and returned soon again with a china dish in her hand , full of a certain liquor , which she presented to the magician , while the other helped her to sit up .
11 `` Drink this liquor , '' said she ; `` it is the Water of the Fountain of Lions , and a sovereign remedy against all fevers whatsoever .
12 You will find the effect of it in less than an hour 's time . ''
13 The magician , to dissemble the better , took it after a great deal of entreaty ; but at last she took the china dish , and , holding back her head , swallowed down the liquor .
14 When she was laid down again the two women covered her up .
15 `` Lie quiet , '' said she who brought her the china cup , `` and get a little sleep if you can .
16 We 'll leave you , and hope to find you perfectly cured when we come again an hour hence . ''
17 The two women came again at the time they said they should , and found the magician up and dressed , and sitting upon the sofa .

15 Now the favorites advised that the Prince should be killed , but the magician advised differently : `` Make him give you all kinds of wonderful things , by the Fairy 's help , till she tires of him and sends him away .
16 As , for example , every time your Majesty goes into the field , you are obliged to be at a great expense , not only in pavilions and tents for your army , but likewise in mules and camels to carry their baggage .
17 Now , might not you engage him to use his interest with the Fairy to procure you a tent which might be carried in a man 's hand , and which should be so large as to shelter your whole army against bad weather ? ''
18 When the magician had finished her speech , the Sultan asked his favorites if they had anything better to propose ; and , finding them all silent , determined to follow the magician 's advice , as the most reasonable and most agreeable to his mild government .
19 Next day the Sultan did as the magician had advised him , and asked for the pavilion .
20 Prince Ahmed never expected that the Sultan his father would have asked such a thing , which at first appeared so difficult , not to say impossible .

8 I wo n't detain you , but perhaps you may not be displeased to see my palace ; follow my women , and they will show it you . ''

1 Fairy Paribanou sat in this hall on a throne of massive gold , enriched with diamonds , rubies , and pearls of an extraordinary size , and attended on each hand by a great number of beautiful fairies , all richly clothed .
2 At the sight of so much majesty , the magician was not only dazzled , but was so amazed that , after she had prostrated herself before the throne , she could not open her lips to thank the Fairy as she proposed .
3 However , Paribanou saved her the trouble , and said to her : `` Good woman , I am glad I had an opportunity to oblige you , and to see you are able to pursue your journey .
4 I wo n't detain you , but perhaps you may not be displeased to see my palace ; follow my women , and they will show it you . ''
5 Then the magician went back and related to the Sultan of the Indies all that had happened , and how very rich Prince Ahmed was since his marriage with the Fairy , richer than all the kings in the world , and how there was danger that he should come and take the throne from his father .
6 Though the Sultan of the Indies was very well persuaded that Prince Ahmed 's natural disposition was good , yet he could not help being concerned at the discourse of the old sorceress , to whom , when she was taking her leave , he said : `` I thank thee for the pains thou hast taken , and thy wholesome advice .
7 I am so sensible of the great importance it is to me that I shall deliberate upon it in council . ''
8 Now the favorites advised that the Prince should be killed , but the magician advised differently : `` Make him give you all kinds of wonderful things , by the Fairy 's help , till she tires of him and sends him away .
9 As , for example , every time your Majesty goes into the field , you are obliged to be at a great expense , not only in pavilions and tents for your army , but likewise in mules and camels to carry their baggage .
10 Now , might not you engage him to use his interest with the Fairy to procure you a tent which might be carried in a man 's hand , and which should be so large as to shelter your whole army against bad weather ? ''
11 When the magician had finished her speech , the Sultan asked his favorites if they had anything better to propose ; and , finding them all silent , determined to follow the magician 's advice , as the most reasonable and most agreeable to his mild government .
12 Next day the Sultan did as the magician had advised him , and asked for the pavilion .
13 Prince Ahmed never expected that the Sultan his father would have asked such a thing , which at first appeared so difficult , not to say impossible .
14 Though he knew not absolutely how great the power of genies and fairies was , he doubted whether it extended so far as to compass such a tent as his father desired .
15 At last he replied : `` Though it is with the greatest reluctance imaginable , I will not fail to ask the favor of my wife your Majesty desires , but will not promise you to obtain it ; and if I should not have the honor to come again to pay you my respects that shall be the sign that I have not had success .

3 Now the favorites advised that the Prince should be killed , but the magician advised differently : `` Make him give you all kinds of wonderful things , by the Fairy 's help , till she tires of him and sends him away .
4 As , for example , every time your Majesty goes into the field , you are obliged to be at a great expense , not only in pavilions and tents for your army , but likewise in mules and camels to carry their baggage .
5 Now , might not you engage him to use his interest with the Fairy to procure you a tent which might be carried in a man 's hand , and which should be so large as to shelter your whole army against bad weather ? ''
6 When the magician had finished her speech , the Sultan asked his favorites if they had anything better to propose ; and , finding them all silent , determined to follow the magician 's advice , as the most reasonable and most agreeable to his mild government .

8 Prince Ahmed never expected that the Sultan his father would have asked such a thing , which at first appeared so difficult , not to say impossible .
9 Though he knew not absolutely how great the power of genies and fairies was , he doubted whether it extended so far as to compass such a tent as his father desired .
10 At last he replied : `` Though it is with the greatest reluctance imaginable , I will not fail to ask the favor of my wife your Majesty desires , but will not promise you to obtain it ; and if I should not have the honor to come again to pay you my respects that shall be the sign that I have not had success .
11 But beforehand , I desire you to forgive me , and consider that you yourself have reduced me to this extremity . ''
12 `` Son , '' replied the Sultan of the Indies , `` I should be very sorry if what I ask of you should cause me the displeasure of never seeing you more .

14 The Prince went back , and was very sad for fear of offending the Fairy .

17 But remember it is the Sultan my father asks this favor . ''
18 `` Prince , '' replied the Fairy , smiling , `` I am sorry that so small a matter should disturb you , and make you so uneasy as you appeared to me . ''
19 Then the Fairy sent for her treasurer , to whom , when she came , she said : `` Nourgihan '' -- which was her name -- `` bring me the largest pavilion in my treasury . ''
20 Nourgiham returned presently with the pavilion , which she could not only hold in her hand , but in the palm of her hand when she shut her fingers , and presented it to her mistress , who gave it to Prince Ahmed to look at .
