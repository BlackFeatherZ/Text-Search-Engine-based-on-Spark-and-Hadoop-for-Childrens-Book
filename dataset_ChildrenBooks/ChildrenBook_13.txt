1 `` Ask not , but eat , '' replied Aladdin .
2 So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time , and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp .
3 She begged him to sell it , and have nothing to do with devils .
4 `` No , '' said Aladdin , `` since chance hath made us aware of its virtues , we will use it , and the ring likewise , which I shall always wear on my finger . ''
5 When they had eaten all the genie had brought , Aladdin sold one of the silver plates , and so on until none were left .
6 He then had recourse to the genie , who gave him another set of plates , and thus they lived for many years .
7 One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone was to stay at home and close his shutters while the Princess , his daughter , went to and from the bath .
8 Aladdin was seized by a desire to see her face , which was very difficult , as she always went veiled .
9 He hid himself behind the door of the bath , and peeped through a chink .
10 The Princess lifted her veil as she went in , and looked so beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight .
11 He went home so changed that his mother was frightened .
12 He told her he loved the Princess so deeply that he could not live without her , and meant to ask her in marriage of her father .
13 His mother , on hearing this , burst out laughing , but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request .
14 She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from the enchanted garden , which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful jewels .
15 She took these with her to please the Sultan , and set out , trusting in the lamp .
16 The Grand Vizier and the lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan .
17 He , however , took no notice of her .
18 She went every day for a week , and stood in the same place .

1 The Vizier , who wanted her for his own son , begged the Sultan to withhold her for three months , in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present .
2 The Sultan granted this , and told Aladdin 's mother that , though he consented to the marriage , she must not appear before him again for three months .
3 Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months , but after two had elapsed his mother , going into the city to buy oil , found every one rejoicing , and asked what was going on .
4 `` Do you not know , '' was the answer , `` that the son of the Grand Vizier is to marry the Sultan 's daughter to-night ? ''
5 Breathless , she ran and told Aladdin , who was overwhelmed at first , but presently bethought him of the lamp .
6 He rubbed it , and the genie appeared , saying , `` What is thy will ? ''
7 Aladdin replied : `` The Sultan , as thou knowest , has broken his promise to me , and the Vizier 's son is to have the Princess .
8 My command is that to-night you bring hither the bride and bridegroom . ''
9 `` Master , I obey , '' said the genie .
10 Aladdin then went to his chamber , where , sure enough , at midnight the genie transported the bed containing the Vizier 's son and the Princess .
11 `` Take this new-married man , '' he said , `` and put him outside in the cold , and return at daybreak . ''
12 Whereupon the genie took the Vizier 's son out of bed , leaving Aladdin with the Princess .
13 `` Fear nothing , '' Aladdin said to her ; `` you are my wife , promised to me by your unjust father , and no harm shall come to you . ''
14 The Princess was too frightened to speak , and passed the most miserable night of her life , while Aladdin lay down beside her and slept soundly .
15 At the appointed hour the genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom , laid him in his place , and transported the bed back to the palace .
16 Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter good-morning .
17 The unhappy Vizier 's son jumped up and hid himself , while the Princess would not say a word , and was very sorrowful .

1 He was made captain of the Sultan 's armies , and won several battles for him , but remained modest and courteous as before , and lived thus in peace and content for several years .
2 But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin , and by his magic arts discovered that Aladdin , instead of perishing miserably in the cave , had escaped , and had married a princess , with whom he was living in great honor and wealth .
3 He knew that the poor tailor 's son could only have accomplished this by means of the lamp , and traveled night and day until he reached the capital of China , bent on Aladdin 's ruin .
4 As he passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a marvellous palace .

11 He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the lamp , and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it .
12 That morning the Princess rose earlier than she had done since she had been carried into Africa by the magician , whose company she was forced to endure once a day .
13 She , however , treated him so harshly that he dared not live there altogether .
14 As she was dressing , one of her women looked out and saw Aladdin .
15 The Princess ran and opened the window , and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up .
16 She called to him to come to her , and great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again .
17 After he had kissed her Aladdin said : `` I beg of you , Princess , in God 's name , before we speak of anything else , for your own sake and mine , tell me that has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice in the hall of four-and-twenty windows , when I went a-hunting . ''
18 `` Alas ! ''
19 she said , `` I am the innocent cause of our sorrows , '' and told him of the exchange of the lamp .
20 `` Now I know , '' cried Aladdin , `` that we have to thank the African magician for this !
