8 And , best of all , she loved to while away the hours in a shady fir-wood , seated upon the bank of a little stream , into which she would cast the flowers she had gathered and watch them float away .
9 The gnome tried hard by every means in his power to please the princess and win her love , but little did he guess the real reason of his lack of success .
10 He imagined that she was too young and inexperienced to care for him ; but that was a mistake , for the truth was that another image already filled her heart .
11 The young Prince Ratibor , whose lands joined her father 's , had won the heart of the princess ; and the lovers had been looking forward to the coming of their wedding-day when the bride 's mysterious disappearance took place .
12 The sad news drove Ratibor distracted , and as the days went on , and nothing could be heard of the princess , he forsook his castle and the society of men , and spent his days in the wild forests , roaming about and crying her name aloud to the trees and rocks .
13 Meanwhile , the maiden , in her gorgeous prison , sighed in secret over her grief , not wishing to arouse the gnome 's suspicions .
14 In her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity , and at last she hit upon a plan .
15 By this time spring once more reigned in the valley , and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth , for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter hand now come to their full size .
16 Day by day the princess pulled up some of them , and made experiments with them , conjuring up now this longed-for person , and now that , just for the pleasure of seeing them as they appeared ; but she really had another purpose in view .
17 One day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee , and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover .
18 ` Fly , dear little bee , towards the east , ' said she , ` to my beloved Ratibor , and softly hum into his ear that I love him only , but that I am a captive in the gnome 's palace under the mountains .
19 Do not forget a single word of my greeting , and bring me back a message from my beloved . '
20 So the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden ; but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him , and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up then and there .

8 So the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden ; but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him , and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up then and there .
9 After that , by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket , and taught him this greeting : ` Hop , little cricket , to Ratibor , and chirp in his ear that I love him only , but that I am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains . '
10 So the cricket hopped off gaily , determined to do his best to deliver his message ; but , alas !
11 a long-legged stork who was prancing along the same road caught him in her cruel beak , and before he could say a word he had disappeared down her throat .
12 These two unlucky ventures did not prevent the princess from trying once more .
13 This time she changed the turnip into a magpie .
14 ` Flutter from tree to tree , chattering bird , ' said she , 'till you come to Ratibor , my love .
15 Tell him that I am a captive , and bid him come with horses and men , the third day from this , to the hill that rises from the Thorny Valley . '
16 The magpie listened , hopped awhile from branch to branch , and then darted away , the princess watching him anxiously as far as she could see .
17 Now Prince Ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods , and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief .
18 One day , as he sat in the shade of an oak tree , dreaming of his lost princess , and sometimes crying her name aloud , he seemed to hear another voice reply to his , and , starting up , he gazed around him , but he could see no one , and he had just made up his mind that he must be mistaken , when the same voice called again , and , looking up sharply , he saw a magpie which hopped to and fro among the twigs .
19 Then Ratibor heard with surprise that the bird was indeed calling him by name .
20 ` Poor chatterpie , ' said he ; ` who taught you to say that name , which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory for ever ? '
21 Thereupon he caught up a great stone , and would have hurled it at the XXXXX , if it had not at that moment uttered the name of the princess .	magpie		beauty|bird|captivity|cricket|life|magpie|means|sight|time|woods

2 In her own mind she was wondering if by any means she might escape from her captivity , and at last she hit upon a plan .
3 By this time spring once more reigned in the valley , and the gnome sent the fires back to their places in the deeps of the earth , for the roots which they had kept warm through all the cruel winter hand now come to their full size .

13 Now Prince Ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods , and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief .
14 One day , as he sat in the shade of an oak tree , dreaming of his lost princess , and sometimes crying her name aloud , he seemed to hear another voice reply to his , and , starting up , he gazed around him , but he could see no one , and he had just made up his mind that he must be mistaken , when the same voice called again , and , looking up sharply , he saw a magpie which hopped to and fro among the twigs .

16 ` Poor chatterpie , ' said he ; ` who taught you to say that name , which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory for ever ? '
17 Thereupon he caught up a great stone , and would have hurled it at the magpie , if it had not at that moment uttered the name of the princess .
18 This was so unexpected that the prince 's arm fell helplessly to his side at the sound , and he stood motionless .

1 One day she changed a tiny turnip into a bee , and sent him off to bring her some news of her lover .
2 ` Fly , dear little bee , towards the east , ' said she , ` to my beloved Ratibor , and softly hum into his ear that I love him only , but that I am a captive in the gnome 's palace under the mountains .
3 Do not forget a single word of my greeting , and bring me back a message from my beloved . '
4 So the bee spread his shining wings and flew away to do as he was bidden ; but before he was out of sight a greedy swallow made a snatch at him , and to the great grief of the princess her messenger was eaten up then and there .
5 After that , by the power of the wonderful wand she summoned a cricket , and taught him this greeting : ` Hop , little cricket , to Ratibor , and chirp in his ear that I love him only , but that I am held captive by the gnome in his palace under the mountains . '
6 So the cricket hopped off gaily , determined to do his best to deliver his message ; but , alas !

5 ` Poor chatterpie , ' said he ; ` who taught you to say that name , which belongs to an unlucky mortal who wishes the earth would open and swallow up him and his memory for ever ? '
6 Thereupon he caught up a great stone , and would have hurled it at the magpie , if it had not at that moment uttered the name of the princess .
7 This was so unexpected that the prince 's arm fell helplessly to his side at the sound , and he stood motionless .
8 But the magpie in the tree , who , like all the rest of his family , was not happy unless he could be for ever chattering , began to repeat the message the princess had taught him ; and as soon as he understood it , Prince Ratibor 's heart was filed with joy .
9 All his gloom and misery vanished in a moment , and he anxiously questioned the welcome messenger as to the fate of the princess .
10 But the magpie knew no more than the lesson he had learnt , so he soon fluttered away ; while the prince hurried back to his castle to gather together a troop of horsemen , full of courage for whatever might befall .
11 The princess meanwhile was craftily pursuing her plan of escape .
12 She left off treating the gnome with coldness and indifference ; indeed , there was a look in her eyes which encouraged him to hope that she might some day return his love , and the idea pleased him mightily .
13 The next day , as soon as the sun rose , she made her appearance decked as a bride , in the wonderful robes and jewels which the fond gnome had prepared for her .
14 Her golden hair was braided and crowned with myrtle blossoms , and her flowing veil sparkled with gems .
15 In these magnificent garments she went to meet the gnome upon the great terrace .
16 ` Loveliest of maidens , ' he stammered , bowing low before her , ` let me gaze into your dear eyes , and read in them that you will no longer refuse my love , but will make me the happiest being the sun shines upon . '
17 So saying he would have drawn aside her veil ; but the princess only held it more closely about her .
18 ` Your constancy has overcome me , ' she said ; ' I can no longer oppose your wishes .
19 But believe my words , and suffer this veil still to hide my blushes and tears . '
20 ` Why tears , beloved one ? '
21 cried the XXXXX anxiously ; ` every tear of yours falls upon my heart like a drop of molten gold .	gnome		bird|castle|gnome|hair|joy|lesson|message|side|wishes|words

1 The magpie listened , hopped awhile from branch to branch , and then darted away , the princess watching him anxiously as far as she could see .
2 Now Prince Ratibor was still spending his life in wandering about the woods , and not even the beauty of the spring could soothe his grief .

16 But his fury was vain , the thunderclouds melted away into a soft mist , and the gnome , after flying about for a while in despair , bewailing to the four winds his unhappy fate , went sorrowfully back to the palace , and stole once more through every room , with many sighs and lamentations .
17 He passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm , and the sight of the princess 's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief .
18 All was lonely , empty , sorrowful ; and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures as he had found men to be .
19 Thereupon he stamped three times upon the earth , and the magic palace , with all its treasures , vanished away into the nothingness out of which he had called it ; and the gnome fled once more to the depths of his underground kingdom .

1 Unwilling as the gnome was to lose sight of his beautiful bride for a moment , he obeyed her commands without delay , and hurried off to begin his task .
2 He skipped along among the turnips as nimble as a grasshopper , and had soon counted them all ; but , to be quite certain that he had made no mistake , he thought he would just run over them again .
3 This time , to his great annoyance , the number was different ; so he reckoned them for the third time , but now the number was not the same as either of the previous ones !
4 And this was hardly to be wondered at , as his mind was full of the princess 's pretty looks and words .
5 As for the maiden , no sooner was her deluded lover fairly out of sight than she began to prepare for flight .
6 She had a fine fresh turnip hidden close at hand , which she changed into a spirited horse , all saddled and bridled , and , springing upon its back , she galloped away over hill and dale till she reached the Thorny Valley , and flung herself into the arms of her beloved Prince Ratibor .
7 Meanwhile the toiling gnome went through his task over and over again till his back ached and his head swam , and he could no longer put two and two together ; but as he felt tolerably certain of the exact number of turnips in the field , big and little together , he hurried back eager to prove to his beloved one what a delightful and submissive husband he would be .
8 He felt very well satisfied with himself as he crossed the mossy lawn to the place where he had left her ; but , alas !
9 she was no longer there .
10 He searched every thicket and path , he looked behind every tree , and gazed into every pond , but without success ; then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room , peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name ; but only echo answered in the marble halls -- there was neither voice nor footstep .
11 Then he began to perceive that something was amiss , and , throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him , he flew out of the palace , and soared high into the air , and saw the fugitive princess in the far distance just as the swift horse carried her across the boundary of his dominions .

14 Indeed , he often became quite separated from his nobles and attendants , and in fact was particularly fond of lonely adventures .
15 Another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well , and could not be seen ; and then , with the knowledge only of his faithful Grand Wazeer , to disguise himself as a pedlar , load a donkey with cheap wares , and travel about .
16 In this way he found out what the common people said about him , and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties .
17 One day his queen presented him with a baby daughter as beautiful as the dawn , and the king himself was so happy and delighted that , for a whole week , he forgot to hunt , and spent the time in public and private rejoicing .
18 Not long afterwards , however , he went out after some deer which were to be found in a far corner of his forests .
19 In the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snow-white stag , and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost .
20 So he put the spurs to his horse , and followed it as hard as he could gallop .
21 Of course all his attendants followed at the best speed that they could manage ; but the king was so splendidly mounted , and the stag was so swift , that , at the end of an hour , the king found that only his favourite hound and himself were in the chase ; all the rest were far , far behind and out of XXXXX .	sight		beat|course|distance|fury|gnome|palace|prize|sight|thicket|time

1 He searched every thicket and path , he looked behind every tree , and gazed into every pond , but without success ; then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room to room , peering into every hole and corner and calling her by name ; but only echo answered in the marble halls -- there was neither voice nor footstep .
2 Then he began to perceive that something was amiss , and , throwing off the mortal form that encumbered him , he flew out of the palace , and soared high into the air , and saw the fugitive princess in the far distance just as the swift horse carried her across the boundary of his dominions .
3 Furiously did the enraged gnome fling two great clouds together , and hurl a thunderbolt after the flying maiden , splintering the rocky barriers which had stood a thousand years .
4 But his fury was vain , the thunderclouds melted away into a soft mist , and the gnome , after flying about for a while in despair , bewailing to the four winds his unhappy fate , went sorrowfully back to the palace , and stole once more through every room , with many sighs and lamentations .
5 He passed through the gardens which for him had lost their charm , and the sight of the princess 's footprints on the golden sand of the pathway renewed his grief .
6 All was lonely , empty , sorrowful ; and the forsaken gnome resolved that he would have no more dealings with such false creatures as he had found men to be .
7 Thereupon he stamped three times upon the earth , and the magic palace , with all its treasures , vanished away into the nothingness out of which he had called it ; and the gnome fled once more to the depths of his underground kingdom .
8 While all this was happening , Prince Ratibor was hurrying away with his prize to a place of safety .
9 With great pomp and triumph he restored the lovely princess to her father , and was then and there married to her , and took her back with him to his own castle .
10 But long after she was dead , and her children too , the villagers would tell the tale of her imprisonment underground , as they sat carving wood in the winter nights .

7 Story Of The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate Once upon a time , far away in the east country , there lived a king who loved hunting so much that , when once there was a deer in sight , he was careless of his own safety .
8 Indeed , he often became quite separated from his nobles and attendants , and in fact was particularly fond of lonely adventures .
9 Another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well , and could not be seen ; and then , with the knowledge only of his faithful Grand Wazeer , to disguise himself as a pedlar , load a donkey with cheap wares , and travel about .
10 In this way he found out what the common people said about him , and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties .
11 One day his queen presented him with a baby daughter as beautiful as the dawn , and the king himself was so happy and delighted that , for a whole week , he forgot to hunt , and spent the time in public and private rejoicing .
12 Not long afterwards , however , he went out after some deer which were to be found in a far corner of his forests .
13 In the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snow-white stag , and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost .
14 So he put the spurs to his horse , and followed it as hard as he could gallop .
15 Of course all his attendants followed at the best speed that they could manage ; but the king was so splendidly mounted , and the stag was so swift , that , at the end of an hour , the king found that only his favourite hound and himself were in the chase ; all the rest were far , far behind and out of sight .
16 Nothing daunted , however , he went on and on , till he perceived that he was entering a valley with great rocky mountains on all sides , and that his horse was getting very tired and trembled at every stride .
17 Worse than all evening was already drawing on , and the sun would soon set .
18 In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag .
19 Every shot fell short , or went wide of the mark ; and at last , just as darkness was setting in , he lost sight altogether of the beast .
20 By this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue , his hound staggered panting along beside him , he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before , and had quite missed his way , and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight .
21 All this was very discouraging , but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful XXXXX .	stag		corner|deer|earth|fatigue|gnome|knowledge|princess|stag|villagers|wares

2 Story Of The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate Once upon a time , far away in the east country , there lived a king who loved hunting so much that , when once there was a deer in sight , he was careless of his own safety .
3 Indeed , he often became quite separated from his nobles and attendants , and in fact was particularly fond of lonely adventures .
4 Another of his favourite amusements was to give out that he was not well , and could not be seen ; and then , with the knowledge only of his faithful Grand Wazeer , to disguise himself as a pedlar , load a donkey with cheap wares , and travel about .
5 In this way he found out what the common people said about him , and how his judges and governors fulfilled their duties .
6 One day his queen presented him with a baby daughter as beautiful as the dawn , and the king himself was so happy and delighted that , for a whole week , he forgot to hunt , and spent the time in public and private rejoicing .
7 Not long afterwards , however , he went out after some deer which were to be found in a far corner of his forests .
8 In the course of the beat his dogs disturbed a beautiful snow-white stag , and directly he saw it the king determined that he would have it at any cost .
9 So he put the spurs to his horse , and followed it as hard as he could gallop .
10 Of course all his attendants followed at the best speed that they could manage ; but the king was so splendidly mounted , and the stag was so swift , that , at the end of an hour , the king found that only his favourite hound and himself were in the chase ; all the rest were far , far behind and out of sight .
11 Nothing daunted , however , he went on and on , till he perceived that he was entering a valley with great rocky mountains on all sides , and that his horse was getting very tired and trembled at every stride .
12 Worse than all evening was already drawing on , and the sun would soon set .
13 In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag .
14 Every shot fell short , or went wide of the mark ; and at last , just as darkness was setting in , he lost sight altogether of the beast .

7 In vain had he sent arrow after arrow at the beautiful stag .
8 Every shot fell short , or went wide of the mark ; and at last , just as darkness was setting in , he lost sight altogether of the beast .
9 By this time his horse could hardly move from fatigue , his hound staggered panting along beside him , he was far away amongst mountains where he had never been before , and had quite missed his way , and not a human creature or dwelling was in sight .
10 All this was very discouraging , but the king would not have minded if he had not lost that beautiful stag .
11 That troubled him a good deal , but he never worried over what he could not help , so he got down from his horse , slipped his arm through the bridle , and led the animal along the rough path in hopes of discovering some shepherd 's hut , or , at least , a cave or shelter under some rock , where he might pass the night .
12 Presently he heard the sound of rushing water , and made towards it .
13 He toiled over a steep rocky shoulder of a hill , and there , just below him , was a stream dashing down a precipitous glen , and , almost beneath his feet , twinkling and flickering from the level of the torrent , was a dim light as of a lamp .
14 Towards this light the king with his horse and hound made his way , sliding and stumbling down a steep , stony path .
15 At the bottom the king found a narrow grassy ledge by the brink of the stream , across which the light from a rude lantern in the mount of a cave shed a broad beam of uncertain light .
16 At the edge of the stream sat an old hermit with a long white beard , who neither spoke nor moved as the king approached , but sat throwing into the stream dry leaves which lay scattered about the ground near him .
17 ` Peace be upon you , ' said the king , giving the usual country salutation .
18 ` And upon you peace , ' answered the hermit ; but still he never looked up , nor stopped what he was doing .
19 For a minute or two the king stood watching him .
20 He noticed that the hermit threw two leaves in at a time , and watched them attentively .
21 Sometimes both were carried rapidly down by the stream ; sometimes only one leaf was carried off , and the other , after whirling slowly round and round on the XXXXX of the current , would come circling back on an eddy to the hermit 's feet .	edge		Peace|beard|chase|deal|dwelling|edge|light|stream|sun|way

12 Morning came , and the king got up , pale and sulky , and , after learning from the hermit which path to take , was soon mounted and found his way home without much difficulty .
13 Directly he reached his palace he wrote a letter to the king of the land of the north , begging him , as a favour , to sell him his slave girl Puruna and her son , and saying that , if he consented , he would send a messenger to receive them at the river which divided the kingdoms .
14 For five days he awaited the reply , and hardly slept or ate , but was as cross as could be all the time .
15 On the fifth day his messenger returned with a letter to say that the king of the land of the north would not sell , but he would give , the king the slave girl and her son .
16 The king was overjoyed .
17 He sent for his Grand Wazeer and told him that he was going on one of his lonely expeditions , and that the Wazeer must invent some excuse to account for his absence .
18 Next he disguised himself as an ordinary messenger , mounted a swift camel , and sped away to the place where the slave girl was to be handed over to him .
19 When he got there he gave the messengers who brought her a letter of thanks and a handsome present for their master and rewards for themselves ; and then without delay he took the poor woman and her tiny baby-boy up on to his camel and rode off to a wild desert .
20 After riding for a day and a night , almost without stopping , he came to a great cave where he made the woman dismount , and , taking her and the baby into the cave , he drew his sword and with one blow chopped her head off .
21 But although his anger made him cruel enough for anything so dreadful , the king felt that he could not turn his great sword on the helpless XXXXX , who he was sure must soon die in this solitary place without its mother ; so he left it in the cave where it was , and , mounting his camel , rode home as fast as he could .	baby		anger|baby|cave|day|favour|letter|north|place|son|teeth

9 Next he disguised himself as an ordinary messenger , mounted a swift camel , and sped away to the place where the slave girl was to be handed over to him .
10 When he got there he gave the messengers who brought her a letter of thanks and a handsome present for their master and rewards for themselves ; and then without delay he took the poor woman and her tiny baby-boy up on to his camel and rode off to a wild desert .
11 After riding for a day and a night , almost without stopping , he came to a great cave where he made the woman dismount , and , taking her and the baby into the cave , he drew his sword and with one blow chopped her head off .
12 But although his anger made him cruel enough for anything so dreadful , the king felt that he could not turn his great sword on the helpless baby , who he was sure must soon die in this solitary place without its mother ; so he left it in the cave where it was , and , mounting his camel , rode home as fast as he could .
13 Now , in a small village in his kingdom there lived an old widow who had no children or relations of any kind .
14 She made her living mostly by selling the milk of a flock of goats ; but she was very , very poor , and not very strong , and often used to wonder how she would live if she got too weak or ill to attend to her goats .
15 Every morning she drove the goats out into the desert to graze on the shrubs and bushes which grew there , and every evening they came home of themselves to be milked and to be shut up safely for the night .
16 One evening the old woman was astonished to find that her very best nanny-goat returned without a drop of milk .
17 She thought that some naughty boy or girl was playing a trick upon her and had caught the goat on its way home and stolen all the milk .
18 But when evening after evening the goat remained almost dry she determined to find out who the thief was .
19 So the next day she followed the goats at a distance and watched them while they grazed .
20 At length , in the afternoon , the old woman noticed this particular nanny-goat stealing off by herself away from the herd and she at once went after her .
21 On and on the XXXXX walked for some way , and then disappeared into a cave in the rocks .	goat		anything|beasts|boy|cross|expeditions|goat|king|place|reply|shelter

1 Then he asked if the hermit could shelter him and his beasts for the night , and the hermit said ` Yes ' ; so , very soon the king had watered and tethered his horse , and , after a supper of bread and parched peas , lay down in the cave , with the hound at his feet , and tried to go to sleep .
2 But instead of sleeping he only lay awake and thought of the hermit 's prophecy ; and the more he thought of it the angrier he felt , until he gnashed his teeth and declared that it should never , never come true .
3 Morning came , and the king got up , pale and sulky , and , after learning from the hermit which path to take , was soon mounted and found his way home without much difficulty .
4 Directly he reached his palace he wrote a letter to the king of the land of the north , begging him , as a favour , to sell him his slave girl Puruna and her son , and saying that , if he consented , he would send a messenger to receive them at the river which divided the kingdoms .
5 For five days he awaited the reply , and hardly slept or ate , but was as cross as could be all the time .
6 On the fifth day his messenger returned with a letter to say that the king of the land of the north would not sell , but he would give , the king the slave girl and her son .

11 Now , in a small village in his kingdom there lived an old widow who had no children or relations of any kind .
12 She made her living mostly by selling the milk of a flock of goats ; but she was very , very poor , and not very strong , and often used to wonder how she would live if she got too weak or ill to attend to her goats .
13 Every morning she drove the goats out into the desert to graze on the shrubs and bushes which grew there , and every evening they came home of themselves to be milked and to be shut up safely for the night .
14 One evening the old woman was astonished to find that her very best nanny-goat returned without a drop of milk .
15 She thought that some naughty boy or girl was playing a trick upon her and had caught the goat on its way home and stolen all the milk .
16 But when evening after evening the goat remained almost dry she determined to find out who the thief was .
17 So the next day she followed the goats at a distance and watched them while they grazed .
18 At length , in the afternoon , the old woman noticed this particular nanny-goat stealing off by herself away from the herd and she at once went after her .
19 On and on the goat walked for some way , and then disappeared into a cave in the rocks .
20 The old woman followed the goat into the cave and then , what should she see but the animal giving her milk to a little boy-baby , whilst on the ground near by lay the sad remains of the baby 's dead mother !
21 Wondering and frightened , the old woman thought at last that this little baby might be a son to her in her old age , and that he would grow up and in XXXXX to come be her comfort and support .	time		Grand|anything|cross|ground|head|home|messenger|path|time|way

17 Wondering and frightened , the old woman thought at last that this little baby might be a son to her in her old age , and that he would grow up and in time to come be her comfort and support .
18 So she carried home the baby to her hut , and next day she took a spade to the cave and dug a grave where she buried the poor mother .
19 Years passed by , and the baby grew up into a find handsome lad , as daring as he was beautiful , and as industrious as he was brave .
20 One day , when the boy , whom the old woman had named Nur Mahomed , was about seventeen years old , he was coming from his day 's work in the fields , when he saw a strange donkey eating the cabbages in the garden which surround their little cottage .
21 Seizing a big stick , he began to beat the intruder and to drive him out of his XXXXX .	garden		baby|boy|camel|flock|garden|grave|length|remains|way|widow

1 When he got there he gave the messengers who brought her a letter of thanks and a handsome present for their master and rewards for themselves ; and then without delay he took the poor woman and her tiny baby-boy up on to his camel and rode off to a wild desert .
2 After riding for a day and a night , almost without stopping , he came to a great cave where he made the woman dismount , and , taking her and the baby into the cave , he drew his sword and with one blow chopped her head off .
3 But although his anger made him cruel enough for anything so dreadful , the king felt that he could not turn his great sword on the helpless baby , who he was sure must soon die in this solitary place without its mother ; so he left it in the cave where it was , and , mounting his camel , rode home as fast as he could .
4 Now , in a small village in his kingdom there lived an old widow who had no children or relations of any kind .
5 She made her living mostly by selling the milk of a flock of goats ; but she was very , very poor , and not very strong , and often used to wonder how she would live if she got too weak or ill to attend to her goats .
6 Every morning she drove the goats out into the desert to graze on the shrubs and bushes which grew there , and every evening they came home of themselves to be milked and to be shut up safely for the night .
7 One evening the old woman was astonished to find that her very best nanny-goat returned without a drop of milk .
8 She thought that some naughty boy or girl was playing a trick upon her and had caught the goat on its way home and stolen all the milk .
9 But when evening after evening the goat remained almost dry she determined to find out who the thief was .
10 So the next day she followed the goats at a distance and watched them while they grazed .
11 At length , in the afternoon , the old woman noticed this particular nanny-goat stealing off by herself away from the herd and she at once went after her .
12 On and on the goat walked for some way , and then disappeared into a cave in the rocks .

3 Wondering and frightened , the old woman thought at last that this little baby might be a son to her in her old age , and that he would grow up and in time to come be her comfort and support .
4 So she carried home the baby to her hut , and next day she took a spade to the cave and dug a grave where she buried the poor mother .
5 Years passed by , and the baby grew up into a find handsome lad , as daring as he was beautiful , and as industrious as he was brave .
6 One day , when the boy , whom the old woman had named Nur Mahomed , was about seventeen years old , he was coming from his day 's work in the fields , when he saw a strange donkey eating the cabbages in the garden which surround their little cottage .

1 A neighbour passing by called out to him -- ` Hi !
2 I say !
3 why are you beating the pedlar 's donkey like that ? '
4 ` The pedlar should keep him from eating my cabbages , ' said Nur Mahomed ; ` if he comes this evening here again I 'll cut off his tail for him ! '
5 Whereupon he went off indoors , whistling cheerfully .
6 It happened that this neighbour was one of those people who make mischief by talking too much ; so , meeting the pedlar in the ` serai , ' or inn , that evening , he told him what had occurred , and added : ` Yes ; and the young spitfire said that if beating the donkey would not do , he would beat you also , and cut your nose off for a thief ! '
7 A few days later , the pedlar having moved on , two men appeared in the village inquiring who it was who had threatened to ill-treat and to murder an innocent pedlar .
8 They declared that the pedlar , in fear of his life , had complained to the king ; and that they had been sent to bring the lawless person who had said these things before the king himself .
9 Of course they soon found out about the donkey eating Nur Mahomed 's cabbages , and about the young man 's hot words ; but although the lad assured them that he had never said anything about murdering anyone , they replied they were ordered to arrest him , and bring him to take his trial before the king .
10 So , in spite of his protests , and the wails of his mother , he was carried off , and in due time brought before the king .
11 Of course Nur Mahomed never guessed that the supposed pedlar happened to have been the king himself , although nobody knew it .

4 But as he was very angry at what he had been told , he declared that he was going to make an example of this young man , and intended to teach him that even poor travelling pedlars could get justice in HIS country , and be protected from such lawlessness .
5 However , just as he was going to pronounce some very heavy sentence , there was a stir in the court , and up came Nur Mahomed 's old mother , weeping and lamenting , and begging to be heard .
6 The king ordered her to speak , and she began to plead for the boy , declaring how good he was , and how he was the support of her old age , and if he were put in prison she would die .
7 The king asked her who she was .
8 She replied that she was his mother .
9 ` His mother ? '
10 said the king ; ` you are too old , surely , to have so young a son ! '
11 Then the old woman , in her fright and distress , confessed the whole story of how she found the baby , and how she rescued and brought him up , and ended by beseeching the king for mercy .
12 It is easy to guess how , as the story came out , the king looked blacker and blacker , and more and more grim , until at last he was half fainting with rage and astonishment .
13 This , then , was the baby he had left to die , after cruelly murdering his mother !
14 Surely fate might have spared him this !
15 He wished he had sufficient excuse to put the boy to death , for the old hermit 's prophecy came back to him as strongly as ever ; and yet the young man had done nothing bad enough to deserve such a punishment .
16 Everyone would call him a tyrant if he were to give such an order -- in fact , he dared not try it !
17 At length he collected himself enough to say : -- ` If this young man will enlist in my army I will let him off .
18 We have need of such as him , and a little discipline will do him good . '
19 Still the old woman pleaded that she could not live without her son , and was nearly as terrified at the idea of his becoming a soldier as she was at the thought of his being put in prison .
20 But at length the king -- determined to get the youth into his clutches -- pacified her by promising her a pension large enough to keep her in comfort ; and Nur Mahomed , to his own great delight , was duly enrolled in the king 's army .

8 Once , while he was taking a journey , a foot-bridge gave way under him ; once he was attacked by armed robbers ; a rock rolled down upon him in a mountain pass ; a heavy stone coping fell from a roof at his feet in a narrow city alley .
9 Altogether , Nur Mahomed began to think that , somewhere or other , he had made an enemy ; but he was light-hearted , and the thought did not much trouble him .
10 He escaped somehow every time , and felt amused rather than anxious about the next adventure .
11 It was the custom of that city that the officer for the day of the palace guards should receive all his food direct from the king 's kitchen .
12 One day , when Nur Mahomed 's turn came to be on duty , he was just sitting down to a delicious stew that had been sent in from the palace , when one of those gaunt , hungry dogs , which , in eastern countries , run about the streets , poked his nose in at the open guard-room door , and looked at Nur Mahomed with mouth watering and nostrils working .
13 The kind-hearted young man picked out a lump of meat , went to the door , and threw it outside to him .
14 The dog pounced upon it , and gulped it down greedily , and was just turning to go , when it staggered , fell , rolled over , and died .
15 Nur Mahomed , who had been lazily watching him , stood still for a moment , then he came back whistling softly .
16 He gathered up the rest of his dinner and carefully wrapped it up to carry away and bury somewhere ; and then he sent back the empty plates .
17 How furious the king was when , at the next morning 's durbar , Nur Mahomed appeared before him fresh , alert and smiling as usual .
18 He was determined , however , to try once more , and bidding the young man come into his presence that evening , gave orders that he was to carry a secret despatch to the governor of a distant province .

3 Nur Mahomed , who was the nearest of the guards , threw himself in the way , and received the stab that had been apparently intended for the king .
4 Luckily the blow was a hurried one , and the dagger glanced on is breastbone , so that , although he received a severe wound , his youth and strength quickly got the better of it .

18 The weather was very hot ; but Nur Mahomed thought that the sooner his precious letter was delivered the better ; so that , by dint of riding most of each night and resting only in the hottest part of the day , he found himself , by noon on the third day , approaching the town which was his final destination .
19 Not a soul was to be seen anywhere ; and Nur Mahomed , stiff , dry , thirsty , and tired , looked longingly over the wall into the gardens , and marked the fountains , the green grass , the shady apricot orchards , and giant mulberry trees , and wished he were there .
20 At length he reached the castle gates , and was at once admitted , as he was in the uniform of the king 's bodyguard .
21 The XXXXX was resting , the soldier said , and could not see him until the evening .	governor		fountains|gardens|governor|letter|man|mind|morning|princess|wall|weather

1 The dog pounced upon it , and gulped it down greedily , and was just turning to go , when it staggered , fell , rolled over , and died .
2 Nur Mahomed , who had been lazily watching him , stood still for a moment , then he came back whistling softly .
3 He gathered up the rest of his dinner and carefully wrapped it up to carry away and bury somewhere ; and then he sent back the empty plates .
4 How furious the king was when , at the next morning 's durbar , Nur Mahomed appeared before him fresh , alert and smiling as usual .
5 He was determined , however , to try once more , and bidding the young man come into his presence that evening , gave orders that he was to carry a secret despatch to the governor of a distant province .
6 ` Make your preparations at once , ' added he , ` and be ready to start in the morning .
7 I myself will deliver you the papers at the last moment . '
8 Now this province was four or five days ' journey from the palace , and the governor of it was the most faithful servant the king had .
9 He could be silent as the grave , and prided himself on his obedience .
10 Whilst he was an old and tried servant of the king 's , his wife had been almost a mother to the young princess ever since the queen had died some years before .
11 It happened that , a little before this time , the princess had been sent away for her health to another remote province ; and whilst she was there her old friend , the governor 's wife , had begged her to come and stay with them as soon as she could .
12 The princess accepted gladly , and was actually staying in the governor 's house at the very time when the king made up his mind to send Nur Mahomed there with the mysterious despatch .
13 According to orders Nur Mahomed presented himself early the next morning at the king 's private apartments .
14 His best horse was saddled , food placed in is saddle-bag , and with some money tied up in his waist-band , he was ready to start .
15 The king handed over to him a sealed packet , desiring him to give it himself only into the hands of the governor , and to no one else .
16 Nur Mahomed hid it carefully in his turban , swung himself into the saddle , and five minutes later rode out of the city gates , and set out on his long journey .

21 So Nur Mahomed handed over his XXXXX to an attendant , and wandered down into the lovely gardens he had seen from the road , and sat down in the shade to rest himself .	horse		grave|health|horse|letter|moment|noon|orders|palace|time|wife

21 Every day , through the heat of the afternoon , the XXXXX , and his wife also , used to lie down for two or three hours in their own rooms , and so , for the matter of that , did most people in the palace .	governor		destination|food|friend|governor|journey|moment|road|town|turban|wall
