14 The nurse coveted the pearls , but as she was three hundred years old she did not know how she could catch a deer .
15 However , she went down into the garden and held out some grass , but when she went near the creature ran away .
16 The girl watched with great excitement from the palace window , and called : ' O nurse , if you do n't catch it , I will kill you ! ' '
17 I am killing myself , ' shouted back the old woman .
18 The girl saw that nurse tottering along and went down to help , marching with the gait of a prancing peacock .
19 When she saw the gilded horns and the kerchief she said : ` It must be accustomed to the hand , and be some royal pet ! '
20 The prince had it in mind that this might be another magician who could give him some other shape , but still it seemed best to allow himself to be caught .
21 So he played about the XXXXX and let her catch him by the neck .	girl		change|girl|heart|leader|leap|palace|pet|place|rest|times

1 The kerchief which that day she had had in her hand was then tied round its neck , and this freed it from her attentions .
2 The prince-deer now bounded into the garden and at once sought some way of escape .
3 It found none , and it joined the other deer , which soon made it their leader .
4 Now , although the prince had been transformed into the form of a deer , he kept his man 's heart and mind .
5 He said to himself , ` Thank heaven that the Lady Latifa has changed me into this shape , for at least deer are beautiful . '
6 He remained for some time living as a deer amongst the rest , but at length resolved that an end to such a life must be put ill some way .
7 He looked again for some place by which he could get out of the magic garden .
8 Following round the wall he reached a lower part ; he remembered the Divine Names and flung himself over , saying , ` Whatever happens is by the will of God . '
9 When he looked about he found that he was in the very same place he had jumped from ; there was the palace , there the garden and the deer !
10 Eight times he leaped over the wall and eight times found himself where he had started from ; but after the ninth leap there was a change , there was a palace and there was a garden , but the deer were gone .
11 Presently a girl of such moon-like beauty opened a window that the prince lost to her a hundred hearts .
12 She was delighted with the beautiful deer , and cried to her nurse : ` Catch it !

3 Having stored these things in the prince 's memory , she said : ` You will see everything happen just as I have said . '
4 Then she escorted him a little way ; they parted , and she went home to mourn his absence .
5 Prince Almas , relying on the Causer of Causes , rode on to the Place of Gifts and dismounted at the platform .
6 Everything happened just as Jamila had foretold ; when one or two watches of the night had passed , he saw that the open ground around him was full of such stately and splendid animals as he had never seen before .
7 By-and-by , they made way for a wonderfully big lion , which was eighty yards from nose to tail-tip , and was a magnificent creature .
8 The prince advanced and saluted it ; it proudly drooped its head and forelocks and paced to the platform .
9 Seventy or eighty others were with it , and now encircled it at a little distance .
10 It laid its right paw over its left , and the prince took the kerchief Jamila had given him for the purpose , and rubbed the dust and earth from its face ; then brought forward the game he had prepared , and crossing his hands respectfully on his breast stood waiting before it .
11 When it wished for food he cut off pieces of the meat and put them in its mouth .
12 The serving lions also came near and the prince would have stayed his hand , but the king-lion signed to him to feed them too .
13 This he did , laying the meat on the platform .
14 Then the king-lion beckoned the prince to come near and said : ` Sleep at ease ; my guards will watch . '
15 .
16 So , surrounded by the lion-guard , he slept till dawn , when the king lion said good-bye , and gave him a few of his own hairs and said : ` When you are in any difficulty , burn one of these and I will be there . '
17 Then it went off into the jungle .
18 Prince Almas immediately started ; he rode till he came to the parting of the ways .
19 He remembered quite well that the right-hand way was short and dangerous , but he bethought himself too that whatever was written on his forehead would happen , and took the forbidden road .
20 By-and-by he saw a castle , and knew from what Jamila had told him that it was the Place of Clashing Swords .
21 He would have liked to go back by the way ho had come , but courage forbade , and he said , ` What has been preordained from eternity will happen to me , ' and went on towards the XXXXX .	castle		Everything|castle|dawn|face|hand|home|paw|pieces|purpose|things

1 He was still dozing when he was aroused by the neighing and pawing of his horse .
2 When he could see clearly he made out a mountain-like dragon whose heavy breast crushed the stones beneath it into putty .
3 He remembered the Thousand Names of God and took the bow of Salih from its case and three arrows from their quiver .
4 He bound the dagger of Timus firmly to his waist and hung the scorpion of Solomon round his neck .
5 Then he set an arrow on the string and released it with such force that it went in at the monster 's eye right up to the notch .

14 By the time the dragon had been killed they were very hungry and set up a clamour for food .
15 The prince therefore cut up the dragon and fed them with it , bit by bit , till they had eaten the whole .

3 When the merchant saw that the prince was in deadly earnest , he said : ` If you wish to hear the truth of the matter you must wait upon our king .

11 In return for the diamond , King Sinaubar showered gifts of much greater value , for he remembered that it was the last possession of the prince .
12 He showed the utmost kindness and hospitality , and gave his wazir orders to instal the prince in the royal guest-house .
13 He took much pleasure in his visitor 's society ; they were together every day and spent the time most pleasantly .
14 Several times the king said : ` Ask me for something , that I may give it you .
15 ` One day he so pressed to know what would pleasure the prince , that the latter said : ' I have only one wish , and that I will name to you in private . '

1 He showed the utmost kindness and hospitality , and gave his wazir orders to instal the prince in the royal guest-house .
2 He took much pleasure in his visitor 's society ; they were together every day and spent the time most pleasantly .
3 Several times the king said : ` Ask me for something , that I may give it you .
4 ` One day he so pressed to know what would pleasure the prince , that the latter said : ' I have only one wish , and that I will name to you in private . '
5 The king at once commanded every one to withdraw , and then Prince Almas said : ` The desire of my life is to know what the rose did to the cypress , and what meaning there is in the words . '
6 The king was astounded .
7 ` In God 's name !
8 if anyone else had said that to me I should have cut off his head instantly . '
9 The prince heard this in silence , and presently so beguiled the king with pleasant talk that to kill him was impossible .
10 Time flew by , the king again and again begged the prince to ask some gift of him , and always received this same reply : ' I wish for your Majesty 's welfare , what more can I desire ?
11 ` One night there was a banquet , and cupbearers carried round gold and silver cups of sparkling wine , and singers with sweetest voices contended for the prize .
12 The prince drank from the king 's own cup , and when his head was hot with wine he took a lute from one of the musicians and placed himself on the carpet border and sang and sang till he witched away the sense of all who listened .
13 Applause and compliments rang from every side .
14 The king filled his cup and called the prince and gave it him and said : ` Name your wish !
15 it is yours . '
16 The prince drained off the wine and answered : ' O king of the world !
17 learn and know that I have only one aim in life , and this is to know what the rose did to the cypress . '
18 ` Never yet , ' replied the king , ` has any man come out from that question alive .
19 If this is your only wish , so be it ; I will tell you .
20 But I will do this on one condition only , namely , that when you have heard you will submit yourself to death . '
21 To this the XXXXX agreed , and said : ' I set my foot firmly on this compact . '	prince		desire|kindness|king|life|orders|pleasure|prince|side|welfare|wine
