5 Before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the Terrible Head out of his wallet and held it up .
6 And when the sea beast leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head , and instantly it was turned into a stone .
7 And the stone beast is there on the sea-coast to this day .
8 Then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the King , her father , where everyone was weeping for her death , and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well .
9 And the King and Queen made much of the boy , and could not contain themselves for delight when they found he wanted to marry their daughter .
10 So the two were married with the most splendid rejoicings , and when they had passed some time at court they went home in a ship to the boy 's own country .
11 For he could not carry his bride through the air , so he took the Shoes of Swiftness , and the Cap of Darkness , and the Sword of Sharpness up to a lonely place in the hills .
12 There he left them , and there they were found by the man and woman who had met him at home beside the sea , and had helped him to start on his journey .
13 When this had been done the boy and his bride set forth for home , and landed at the harbor of his native land .
14 But whom should he meet in the very street of the town but his own mother , flying for her life from the wicked King , who now wished to kill her because he found that she would never marry him !
15 For if she had liked the King ill before , she liked him far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly .
16 She did not know , of course , where the boy had gone , but thought the King had slain him secretly .
17 So now she was running for her very life , and the wicked King was following her with a sword in his hand .
18 Then , behold !
19 she ran into her son 's very arms , but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her , when the King struck at him with his sword .
20 The boy caught the blow on his shield , and cried to the King : `` I swore to bring you the Terrible Head , and see how I keep my oath ! ''
21 Then he drew forth the XXXXX from his wallet , and when the King 's eyes fell on it , instantly he was turned into stone , just as he stood there with his sword lifted !	head		arms|beast|blow|bride|course|father|head|life|wallet|woman

2 And she told him that she was the daughter of the King of that country , and that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea ; for the beast came and devoured a girl every day .
3 Now the lot had fallen on her ; and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl .
4 But the beast had been too greedy and too hurried , so he missed his aim the first time .
5 Before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the Terrible Head out of his wallet and held it up .

5 There he left them , and there they were found by the man and woman who had met him at home beside the sea , and had helped him to start on his journey .
6 When this had been done the boy and his bride set forth for home , and landed at the harbor of his native land .
7 But whom should he meet in the very street of the town but his own mother , flying for her life from the wicked King , who now wished to kill her because he found that she would never marry him !
8 For if she had liked the King ill before , she liked him far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly .
9 She did not know , of course , where the boy had gone , but thought the King had slain him secretly .
10 So now she was running for her very life , and the wicked King was following her with a sword in his hand .
11 Then , behold !
12 she ran into her son 's very arms , but he had only time to kiss her and step in front of her , when the King struck at him with his sword .
13 The boy caught the blow on his shield , and cried to the King : `` I swore to bring you the Terrible Head , and see how I keep my oath ! ''
14 Then he drew forth the head from his wallet , and when the King 's eyes fell on it , instantly he was turned into stone , just as he stood there with his sword lifted !
15 Now all the people rejoiced , because the wicked King should rule them no longer .
16 And they asked the boy to be their king , but he said no , he must take his mother home to her father 's house .
17 So the people chose for king the man who had been kind to his mother when first she was cast on the island in the great chest .
18 Presently the boy and his mother and his wife set sail for his mother 's own country , from which she had been driven so unkindly .
19 But on the way they stayed at the court of a king , and it happened that he was holding games , and giving prizes to the best runners , boxers , and quoit-throwers .
20 Then the boy would try his strength with the rest , but he threw the quoit so far that it went beyond what had ever been thrown before , and fell in the crowd , striking a man so that he died .
21 Now this man was no other than the XXXXX of the boy 's mother , who had fled away from his own kingdom for fear his grandson should find him and kill him after all .	father		blow|father|games|harbor|land|people|son|stone|town|woman

1 Then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the King , her father , where everyone was weeping for her death , and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw her come back well .
2 And the King and Queen made much of the boy , and could not contain themselves for delight when they found he wanted to marry their daughter .

1 The ambassador set off sadly on his homeward way , bringing all the King 's presents back with him , for the Princess was too well brought up to accept the pearls and diamonds when she would not accept the King , so she had only kept twenty-five English pins that he might not be vexed .
2 When the ambassador reached the city , where the King was waiting impatiently , everybody was very much annoyed with him for not bringing the Princess , and the King cried like a baby , and nobody could console him .
3 Now there was at the Court a young man , who was more clever and handsome than anyone else .
4 He was called Charming , and everyone loved him , excepting a few envious people who were angry at his being the King 's favorite and knowing all the State secrets .
5 He happened to one day be with some people who were speaking of the ambassador 's return and saying that his going to the Princess had not done much good , when Charming said rashly : `` If the King had sent me to the Princess Goldilocks I am sure she would have come back with me . ''
6 His enemies at once went to the King and said : `` You will hardly believe , sire , what Charming has the audacity to say -- that if he had been sent to the Princess Goldilocks she would certainly have come back with him .
7 He seems to think that he is so much handsomer than you that the Princess would have fallen in love with him and followed him willingly . ''
8 The King was very angry when he heard this .
9 `` Ha , ha ! ''
10 said he ; `` does he laugh at my unhappiness , and think himself more fascinating than I am ?
11 Go , and let him be shut up in my great tower to die of hunger . ''
12 So the King 's guards went to fetch Charming , who had thought no more of his rash speech , and carried him off to prison with great cruelty .
13 The poor prisoner had only a little straw for his bed , and but for a little stream of water which flowed through the tower he would have died of thirst .
14 One day when he was in despair he said to himself : `` How can I have offended the King ?
15 I am his most faithful subject , and have done nothing against him . ''
16 The King chanced to be passing the tower and recognized the voice of his former favorite .
17 He stopped to listen in spite of Charming 's enemies , who tried to persuade him to have nothing more to do with the traitor .

3 But Charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride , and the King , who was delighted at his being ready to start so promptly , gave him letters to the Princess , and bade him good speed .
4 It was on a Monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand , thinking of nothing but how he could persuade the Princess Goldilocks to marry the King .
5 He had a writing-book in his pocket , and whenever any happy thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down under the trees to put it into the harangue which he was preparing for the Princess , before he forgot it .
6 One day when he had started at the very earliest dawn , and was riding over a great meadow , he suddenly had a capital idea , and , springing from his horse , he sat down under a willow tree which grew by a little river .
7 When he had written it down he was looking round him , pleased to find himself in such a pretty place , when all at once he saw a great golden carp lying gasping and exhausted upon the grass .
8 In leaping after little flies she had thrown herself high upon the bank , where she had lain till she was nearly dead .
9 Charming had pity upon her , and , though he could n't help thinking that she would have been very nice for dinner , he picked her up gently and put her back into the water .
10 As soon as Dame Carp felt the refreshing coolness of the water she sank down joyfully to the bottom of the river , then , swimming up to the bank quite boldly , she said : `` I thank you , Charming , for the kindness you have done me .
11 You have saved my life ; one day I will repay you . ''
12 So saying , she sank down into the water again , leaving Charming greatly astonished at her politeness .
13 Another day , as he journeyed on , he saw a raven in great distress .
14 The poor bird was closely pursued by an eagle , which would soon have eaten it up , had not Charming quickly fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the eagle dead .
15 The raven perched upon a tree very joyfully .
16 `` Charming , '' said he , `` it was very generous of you to rescue a poor raven ; I am not ungrateful , some day I will repay you . ''
17 Charming thought it was very nice of the raven to say so , and went on his way .
18 Before the sun rose he found himself in a thick wood where it was too dark for him to see his path , and here he heard an owl crying as if it were in despair .
19 `` Hark ! ''
20 said he , `` that must be an owl in great trouble , I am sure it has gone into a snare '' ; and he began to hunt about , and presently found a great net which some bird-catchers had spread the night before .

13 Let somebody make me fresh garlands of flowers , and give me my high-heeled shoes and my fan , and tell them to sweep my great hall and my throne , for I want everyone to say I am really ` Pretty Goldilocks . ' ''
14 You can imagine how all her maids scurried this way and that to make the Princess ready , and how in their haste they knocked their heads together and hindered each other , till she thought they would never have done .
15 However , at last they led her into the gallery of mirrors that she might assure herself that nothing was lacking in her appearance , and then she mounted her throne of gold , ebony , and ivory , while her ladies took their guitars and began to sing softly .
16 Then Charming was led in , and was so struck with astonishment and admiration that at first not a word could he say .
17 But presently he took courage and delivered his harangue , bravely ending by begging the Princess to spare him the disappointment of going back without her .
18 `` Sir Charming , '' answered she , `` all the reasons you have given me are very good ones , and I assure you that I should have more pleasure in obliging you than anyone else , but you must know that a month ago as I was walking by the river with my ladies I took off my glove , and as I did so a ring that I was wearing slipped off my finger and rolled into the water .
19 As I valued it more than my kingdom , you may imagine how vexed I was at losing it , and I vowed to never listen to any proposal of marriage unless the ambassador first brought me back my ring .
20 So now you know what is expected of you , for if you talked for fifteen days and fifteen nights you could not make me change my mind . ''
21 Charming was very much surprised by this answer , but he bowed low to the Princess , and begged her to accept the embroidered XXXXX and the tiny dog he had brought with him .	scarf		admiration|arrival|dress|everybody|look|maids|neighbor|pebbles|scarf|word

2 These three adventures were the only ones of any consequence that befell Charming upon his journey , and he made all the haste he could to reach the palace of the Princess Goldilocks .
3 When he arrived he thought everything he saw delightful and magnificent .
4 Diamonds were as plentiful as pebbles , and the gold and silver , the beautiful dresses , the sweetmeats and pretty things that were everywhere quite amazed him ; he thought to himself : `` If the Princess consents to leave all this , and come with me to marry the King , he may think himself lucky ! ''
5 Then he dressed himself carefully in rich brocade , with scarlet and white plumes , and threw a splendid embroidered scarf over his shoulder , and , looking as gay and as graceful as possible , he presented himself at the door of the palace , carrying in his arm a tiny pretty dog which he had bought on the way .
6 The guards saluted him respectfully , and a messenger was sent to the Princess to announce the arrival of Charming as ambassador of her neighbor the King .
7 `` Charming , '' said the Princess , `` the name promises well ; I have no doubt that he is good looking and fascinates everybody . ''
8 `` Indeed he does , madam , '' said all her maids of honor in one breath .
9 `` We saw him from the window of the garret where we were spinning flax , and we could do nothing but look at him as long as he was in sight . ''
10 `` Well to be sure , '' said the Princess , `` that 's how you amuse yourselves , is it ?

4 Charming was rather dismayed at this command , but he answered : `` Very well , Princess , I will fight this Galifron ; I believe that he will kill me , but at any rate I shall die in your defense . ''
5 Then the Princess was frightened and said everything she could think of to prevent Charming from fighting the giant , but it was of no use , and he went out to arm himself suitably , and then , taking little Frisk with him , he mounted his horse and set out for Galifron 's country .
6 Everyone he met told him what a terrible giant Galifron was , and that nobody dared go near him ; and the more he heard , the more frightened he grew .
7 Frisk tried to encourage him by saying : `` While you are fighting the giant , dear master , I will go and bite his heels , and when he stoops down to look at me you can kill him . ''
8 Charming praised his little dog 's plan , but knew that this help would not do much good .
9 At last he drew near the giant 's castle , and saw to his horror that every path that led to it was strewn with bones .
10 Before long he saw Galifron coming .
11 His head was higher than the tallest trees , and he sang in a terrible voice : `` Bring out your little boys and girls , Pray do not stay to do their curls , For I shall eat so very many , I shall not know if they have any . ''
12 Thereupon Charming sang out as loud as he could to the same tune : `` Come out and meet the valiant Charming Who finds you not at all alarming ; Although he is not very tall , He 's big enough to make you fall . ''
13 The rhymes were not very correct , but you see he had made them up so quickly that it is a miracle that they were not worse ; especially as he was horribly frightened all the time .
14 When Galifron heard these words he looked all about him , and saw Charming standing , sword in hand this put the giant into a terrible rage , and he aimed a blow at Charming with his huge iron club , which would certainly have killed him if it had reached him , but at that instant a raven perched upon the giant 's head , and , pecking with its strong beak and beating with its great wings so confused and blinded him that all his blows fell harmlessly upon the air , and Charming , rushing in , gave him several strokes with his sharp sword so that he fell to the ground .
15 Whereupon Charming cut off his head before he knew anything about it , and the raven from a tree close by croaked out : `` You see I have not forgotten the good turn you did me in killing the eagle .
16 To-day I think I have fulfilled my promise of repaying you . ''
17 `` Indeed , I owe you more gratitude than you ever owed me , '' replied Charming .
18 And then he mounted his horse and rode off with Galifron 's head .
19 When he reached the city the people ran after him in crowds , crying : `` Behold the brave Charming , who has killed the giant ! ''
20 And their shouts reached the Princess 's ear , but she dared not ask what was happening , for fear she should hear that Charming had been killed .
21 But very soon he arrived at the palace with the XXXXX 's head , of which she was still terrified , though it could no longer do her any harm .	giant		anything|city|command|giant|girls|horse|miracle|shouts|time|tree

10 But Charming only answered : `` I could not have done anything that would have vexed my master so much , even for a kingdom , or to please you , though I think you are as beautiful as the sun . ''
11 At last they reached the King 's great city , and he came out to meet the Princess , bringing magnificent presents , and the marriage was celebrated with great rejoicings .
12 But Goldilocks was so fond of Charming that she could not be happy unless he was near her , and she was always singing his praises .
13 `` If it had n't been for Charming , '' she said to the King , `` I should never have come here ; you ought to be very much obliged to him , for he did the most impossible things and got me water from the Fountain of Beauty , so I can never grow old , and shall get prettier every year . ''
14 Then Charming 's enemies said to the King : `` It is a wonder that you are not jealous , the Queen thinks there is nobody in the world like Charming .
15 As if anybody you had sent could not have done just as much ! ''
16 `` It is quite true , now I come to think of it , '' said the King .
17 `` Let him be chained hand and foot , and thrown into the tower . ''
18 So they took Charming , and as a reward for having served the King so faithfully he was shut up in the tower , where he only saw the jailer , who brought him a piece of black bread and a pitcher of water every day .
19 However , little Frisk came to console him , and told him all the news .
20 When Pretty Goldilocks heard what had happened she threw herself at the King 's feet and begged him to set Charming free , but the more she cried , the more angry he was , and at last she saw that it was useless to say any more ; but it made her very sad .
21 Then the King took it into his head that perhaps he was not handsome enough to please the Princess Goldilocks , and he thought he would bathe his face with the water from the Fountain of Beauty , which was in the XXXXX on a shelf in the Princess 's room , where she had placed it that she might see it often .	flask		bread|cavern|companion|flask|foot|hand|king|nobody|water|ways

10 `` It is quite true , now I come to think of it , '' said the King .
11 `` Let him be chained hand and foot , and thrown into the tower . ''
12 So they took Charming , and as a reward for having served the King so faithfully he was shut up in the tower , where he only saw the jailer , who brought him a piece of black bread and a pitcher of water every day .
13 However , little Frisk came to console him , and told him all the news .
14 When Pretty Goldilocks heard what had happened she threw herself at the King 's feet and begged him to set Charming free , but the more she cried , the more angry he was , and at last she saw that it was useless to say any more ; but it made her very sad .
15 Then the King took it into his head that perhaps he was not handsome enough to please the Princess Goldilocks , and he thought he would bathe his face with the water from the Fountain of Beauty , which was in the flask on a shelf in the Princess 's room , where she had placed it that she might see it often .
16 Now it happened that one of the Princess 's ladies in chasing a spider had knocked the flask off the shelf and broken it , and every drop of the water had been spilt .
17 Not knowing what to do , she had hastily swept away the pieces of crystal , and then remembered that in the King 's room she had seen a flask of exactly the same shape , also filled with sparkling water .
18 So , without saying a word , she fetched it and stood it upon the Queen 's shelf .
19 Now the water in this flask was what was used in the kingdom for getting rid of troublesome people .
20 Instead of having their heads cut off in the usual way , their faces were bathed with the water , and they instantly fell asleep and never woke up any more .
21 So , when the King , thinking to improve his beauty , took the flask and sprinkled the XXXXX upon his face , he fell asleep , and nobody could wake him .	water		Charming|Pretty|anybody|faces|hand|marriage|shelf|sun|things|water

4 But Charming only answered : `` I could not have done anything that would have vexed my master so much , even for a kingdom , or to please you , though I think you are as beautiful as the sun . ''
5 At last they reached the King 's great city , and he came out to meet the Princess , bringing magnificent presents , and the marriage was celebrated with great rejoicings .
6 But Goldilocks was so fond of Charming that she could not be happy unless he was near her , and she was always singing his praises .
7 `` If it had n't been for Charming , '' she said to the King , `` I should never have come here ; you ought to be very much obliged to him , for he did the most impossible things and got me water from the Fountain of Beauty , so I can never grow old , and shall get prettier every year . ''

2 When Pretty Goldilocks heard what had happened she threw herself at the King 's feet and begged him to set Charming free , but the more she cried , the more angry he was , and at last she saw that it was useless to say any more ; but it made her very sad .
3 Then the King took it into his head that perhaps he was not handsome enough to please the Princess Goldilocks , and he thought he would bathe his face with the water from the Fountain of Beauty , which was in the flask on a shelf in the Princess 's room , where she had placed it that she might see it often .
4 Now it happened that one of the Princess 's ladies in chasing a spider had knocked the flask off the shelf and broken it , and every drop of the water had been spilt .
5 Not knowing what to do , she had hastily swept away the pieces of crystal , and then remembered that in the King 's room she had seen a flask of exactly the same shape , also filled with sparkling water .
6 So , without saying a word , she fetched it and stood it upon the Queen 's shelf .
7 Now the water in this flask was what was used in the kingdom for getting rid of troublesome people .
8 Instead of having their heads cut off in the usual way , their faces were bathed with the water , and they instantly fell asleep and never woke up any more .
9 So , when the King , thinking to improve his beauty , took the flask and sprinkled the water upon his face , he fell asleep , and nobody could wake him .
10 Little Frisk was the first to hear the news , and he ran to tell Charming , who sent him to beg the Princess not to forget the poor prisoner .
11 All the palace was in confusion on account of the King 's death , but tiny Frisk made his way through the crowd to the Princess 's side , and said : `` Madam , do not forget poor Charming . ''
12 Then she remembered all he had done for her , and without saying a word to anyone went straight to the tower , and with her own hands took off Charming 's chains .
13 Then , putting a golden crown upon his head , and the royal mantle upon his shoulders , she said : `` Come , faithful Charming , I make you king , and will take you for my husband . ''
14 Charming , once more free and happy , fell at her feet and thanked her for her gracious words .
15 Everybody was delighted that he should be king , and the wedding , which took place at once , was the prettiest that can be imagined , and Prince Charming and Princess Goldilocks lived happily ever after .

7 This pleased little Whittington very much , as he wanted to see London sadly , for he had heard that the streets were paved with gold , and he was willing to get a bushel of it ; but how great was his disappointment , poor boy !
8 when he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold , and found himself in a strange place , without a friend , without food , and without money .
9 Though the wagoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by the side of the wagon for nothing , he took care not to know him when he came to town , and the poor boy was , in a little time , so cold and hungry that he wished himself in a good kitchen and by a warm fire in the country .
10 In his distress he asked charity of several people , and one of them bid him `` Go to work for an idle rogue . ''
11 `` That I will , '' said Whittington , `` with all my heart ; I will work for you if you will let me . ''
12 The man , who thought this savored of wit and impertinence -LRB- though the poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work -RRB- , gave him a blow with a stick which broke his head so that the blood ran down .
13 In this situation , and fainting for want of food , he laid himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren , a merchant , where the cook saw him , and , being an ill-natured hussy , ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him .
14 At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange , and began also to scold at the poor boy , bidding him to go to work .
15 Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him , and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat , for he had had nothing for three days , and he was a poor country boy , and knew nobody , and nobody would employ him .
16 He then endeavored to get up , but he was so very weak that he fell down again , which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink , and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about .
17 People are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle , but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do , or considering whether they are able to do it , which is not charity .
18 But we return to Whittington , who could have lived happy in this worthy family had he not been bumped about by the cross cook , who must be always roasting and basting , or when the spit was idle employed her hands upon poor Whittington !
19 At last Miss Alice , his master 's daughter , was informed of it , and then she took compassion on the poor boy , and made the servants treat him kindly .
20 Besides the crossness of the cook , Whittington had another difficulty to get over before he could be happy .
21 He had , by order of his XXXXX , a flock-bed placed for him in a garret , where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boy 's nose and disturbed him in his sleep .	master		anybody|bushel|business|colt|crown|king|master|rogue|shoulders|streets

1 He strolled about the country as ragged as a colt , till he met with a wagoner who was going to London , and who gave him leave to walk all the way by the side of his wagon without paying anything for his passage .

4 Though the wagoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by the side of the wagon for nothing , he took care not to know him when he came to town , and the poor boy was , in a little time , so cold and hungry that he wished himself in a good kitchen and by a warm fire in the country .
5 In his distress he asked charity of several people , and one of them bid him `` Go to work for an idle rogue . ''

7 The man , who thought this savored of wit and impertinence -LRB- though the poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work -RRB- , gave him a blow with a stick which broke his head so that the blood ran down .
8 In this situation , and fainting for want of food , he laid himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren , a merchant , where the cook saw him , and , being an ill-natured hussy , ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him .
9 At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange , and began also to scold at the poor boy , bidding him to go to work .
10 Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him , and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat , for he had had nothing for three days , and he was a poor country boy , and knew nobody , and nobody would employ him .
11 He then endeavored to get up , but he was so very weak that he fell down again , which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink , and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about .

16 He had , by order of his master , a flock-bed placed for him in a garret , where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boy 's nose and disturbed him in his sleep .
17 After some time , however , a gentleman who came to his master 's house gave Whittington a penny for brushing his shoes .

8 Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him , and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat , for he had had nothing for three days , and he was a poor country boy , and knew nobody , and nobody would employ him .
9 He then endeavored to get up , but he was so very weak that he fell down again , which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink , and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about .
10 People are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle , but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do , or considering whether they are able to do it , which is not charity .

13 Besides the crossness of the cook , Whittington had another difficulty to get over before he could be happy .
14 He had , by order of his master , a flock-bed placed for him in a garret , where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boy 's nose and disturbed him in his sleep .
15 After some time , however , a gentleman who came to his master 's house gave Whittington a penny for brushing his shoes .
16 This he put into his pocket , being determined to lay it out to the best advantage ; and the next day , seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm , he ran up to know the price of it .
17 The woman -LRB- as the cat was a good mouser -RRB- asked a deal of money for it , but on Whittington 's telling her he had but a penny in the world , and that he wanted a cat sadly , she let him have it .
18 This cat Whittington concealed in the garret , for fear she should be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook , and here she soon killed or frightened away the rats and mice , so that the poor boy could now sleep as sound as a top .
19 Soon after this the merchant , who had a ship ready to sail , called for his servants , as his custom was , in order that each of them might venture something to try their luck ; and whatever they sent was to pay neither freight nor custom , for he thought justly that God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of his fortune .
20 All the servants appeared but poor Whittington , who , having neither money nor goods , could not think of sending anything to try his luck ; but his good friend Miss Alice , thinking his poverty kept him away , ordered him to be called .
21 She then offered to lay down something for him , but the merchant told his daughter that would not do , it must be XXXXX of his own .	something		anything|charity|concern|custom|enemy|mice|side|something|wit|woman

2 In this situation , and fainting for want of food , he laid himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren , a merchant , where the cook saw him , and , being an ill-natured hussy , ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him .
3 At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange , and began also to scold at the poor boy , bidding him to go to work .
4 Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would employ him , and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to eat , for he had had nothing for three days , and he was a poor country boy , and knew nobody , and nobody would employ him .
5 He then endeavored to get up , but he was so very weak that he fell down again , which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink , and let him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about .
6 People are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle , but give themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do , or considering whether they are able to do it , which is not charity .

8 At last Miss Alice , his master 's daughter , was informed of it , and then she took compassion on the poor boy , and made the servants treat him kindly .
9 Besides the crossness of the cook , Whittington had another difficulty to get over before he could be happy .
10 He had , by order of his master , a flock-bed placed for him in a garret , where there was a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor boy 's nose and disturbed him in his sleep .
11 After some time , however , a gentleman who came to his master 's house gave Whittington a penny for brushing his shoes .
12 This he put into his pocket , being determined to lay it out to the best advantage ; and the next day , seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm , he ran up to know the price of it .
13 The woman -LRB- as the cat was a good mouser -RRB- asked a deal of money for it , but on Whittington 's telling her he had but a penny in the world , and that he wanted a cat sadly , she let him have it .
14 This cat Whittington concealed in the garret , for fear she should be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook , and here she soon killed or frightened away the rats and mice , so that the poor boy could now sleep as sound as a top .
15 Soon after this the merchant , who had a ship ready to sail , called for his servants , as his custom was , in order that each of them might venture something to try their luck ; and whatever they sent was to pay neither freight nor custom , for he thought justly that God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of his fortune .
16 All the servants appeared but poor Whittington , who , having neither money nor goods , could not think of sending anything to try his luck ; but his good friend Miss Alice , thinking his poverty kept him away , ordered him to be called .
17 She then offered to lay down something for him , but the merchant told his daughter that would not do , it must be something of his own .

1 Soon after this the merchant , who had a ship ready to sail , called for his servants , as his custom was , in order that each of them might venture something to try their luck ; and whatever they sent was to pay neither freight nor custom , for he thought justly that God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of his fortune .
2 All the servants appeared but poor Whittington , who , having neither money nor goods , could not think of sending anything to try his luck ; but his good friend Miss Alice , thinking his poverty kept him away , ordered him to be called .
3 She then offered to lay down something for him , but the merchant told his daughter that would not do , it must be something of his own .
4 Upon which poor Whittington said he had nothing but a cat which he bought for a penny that was given him .
5 `` Fetch thy cat , boy , '' said the merchant , `` and send her . ''
6 Whittington brought poor puss and delivered her to the captain , with tears in his eyes , for he said he should now be disturbed by the rats and mice as much as ever .
7 All the company laughed at the adventure but Miss Alice , who pitied the poor boy , and gave him something to buy another cat .
8 While puss was beating the billows at sea , poor Whittington was severely beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook , who used him so cruelly , and made such game of him for sending his cat to sea , that at last the poor boy determined to run away from his place , and having packed up the few things he had , he set out very early in the morning on All-Hallows day .
9 He traveled as far as Holloway , and there sat down on a stone to consider what course he should take ; but while he was thus ruminating , Bow bells , of which there were only six , began to ring ; and he thought their sounds addressed him in this manner : `` Turn again , Whittington , Thrice Lord Mayor of London . ''
10 `` Lord Mayor of London ! ''
11 said he to himself , `` what would not one endure to be Lord Mayor of London , and ride in such a fine coach ?
12 Well , I 'll go back again , and bear all the pummelling and ill-usage of Cicely rather than miss the opportunity of being Lord Mayor ! ''
13 So home he went , and happily got into the house and about his business before Mrs. Cicely made her appearance .
14 We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa .
15 How perilous are voyages at sea , how uncertain the winds and the waves , and how many accidents attend a naval life !
16 The ship that had the cat on board was long beaten at sea , and at last , by contrary winds , driven on a part of the coast of Barbary which was inhabited by Moors unknown to the English .

1 While puss was beating the billows at sea , poor Whittington was severely beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook , who used him so cruelly , and made such game of him for sending his cat to sea , that at last the poor boy determined to run away from his place , and having packed up the few things he had , he set out very early in the morning on All-Hallows day .
2 He traveled as far as Holloway , and there sat down on a stone to consider what course he should take ; but while he was thus ruminating , Bow bells , of which there were only six , began to ring ; and he thought their sounds addressed him in this manner : `` Turn again , Whittington , Thrice Lord Mayor of London . ''
3 `` Lord Mayor of London ! ''
4 said he to himself , `` what would not one endure to be Lord Mayor of London , and ride in such a fine coach ?
5 Well , I 'll go back again , and bear all the pummelling and ill-usage of Cicely rather than miss the opportunity of being Lord Mayor ! ''
6 So home he went , and happily got into the house and about his business before Mrs. Cicely made her appearance .
7 We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa .
8 How perilous are voyages at sea , how uncertain the winds and the waves , and how many accidents attend a naval life !
9 The ship that had the cat on board was long beaten at sea , and at last , by contrary winds , driven on a part of the coast of Barbary which was inhabited by Moors unknown to the English .
10 These people received our countrymen with civility , and therefore the captain , in order to trade with them , showed them the patterns of the goods he had on board , and sent some of them to the King of the country , who was so well pleased that he sent for the captain and the factor to come to his palace , which was about a mile from the sea .
11 Here they were placed , according to the custom of the country , on rich carpets , flowered with gold and silver ; and the King and Queen being seated at the upper end of the room , dinner was brought in , which consisted of many dishes ; but no sooner were the dishes put down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all quarters and devoured all the meat in an instant .
12 The factor , in surprise , turned round to the nobles and asked if these vermin were not offensive .
13 `` Oh !
14 yes , '' said they , `` very offensive ; and the King would give half his treasure to be freed of them , for they not only destroy his dinner , as you see , but they assault him in his chamber , and even in bed , so that he is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping , for fear of them . ''

7 The factor , in surprise , turned round to the nobles and asked if these vermin were not offensive .
8 `` Oh !

10 The factor jumped for joy ; he remembered poor Whittington and his cat , and told the King he had a creature on board the ship that would despatch all these vermin immediately .
11 The King 's heart heaved so high at the joy which this news gave him that his turban dropped off his head .

6 The dream of the second was that the King had brought her a spinning wheel and a distaff , that she might spin him some shirts .
7 But the youngest said : `` I dreamed that my second sister was to be married , and on her wedding-day , you , father , held a golden ewer and said : ` Come , Miranda , and I will hold the water that you may dip your hands in it . ' ''
8 The King was very angry indeed when he heard this dream , and frowned horribly ; indeed , he made such an ugly face that everyone knew how angry he was , and he got up and went off to bed in a great hurry ; but he could not forget his daughter 's dream .
9 `` Does the proud girl wish to make me her slave ? ''
10 he said to himself .
11 `` I am not surprised at her choosing to dress herself in white satin without a thought of me .
12 She does not think me worthy of her consideration !
13 But I will soon put an end to her pretensions ! ''
14 He rose in a fury , and although it was not yet daylight , he sent for the Captain of his Bodyguard , and said to him : `` You have heard the Princess Miranda 's dream ?
15 I consider that it means strange things against me , therefore I order you to take her away into the forest and kill her , and , that I may be sure it is done , you must bring me her heart and her tongue .
16 If you attempt to deceive me you shall be put to death ! ''
17 The Captain of the Guard was very much astonished when he heard this barbarous order , but he did not dare to contradict the King for fear of making him still more angry , or causing him to send someone else , so he answered that he would fetch the Princess and do as the King had said .
18 When he went to her room they would hardly let him in , it was so early , but he said that the King had sent for Miranda , and she got up quickly and came out ; a little black girl called Patypata held up her train , and her pet monkey and her little dog ran after her .
19 The monkey was called Grabugeon , and the little dog Tintin .
20 The Captain of the Guard begged Miranda to come down into the garden where the King was enjoying the fresh air , and when they got there , he pretended to search for him , but as he was not to be found , he said : `` No doubt his Majesty has strolled into the forest , '' and he opened the little door that led to it and they went through .
21 By this XXXXX the daylight had begun to appear , and the Princess , looking at her conductor , saw that he had tears in his eyes and seemed too sad to speak .	time		dog|dress|eldest|father|fear|monkey|order|stones|things|time
