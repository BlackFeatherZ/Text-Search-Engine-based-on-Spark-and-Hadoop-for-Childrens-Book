9 On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King 's palace , and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride , and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister .
10 But when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the palace one of the trace-pins broke , and , though they made one , two , and three to put in its place , that did not help them , for each broke in turn , no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of .
11 This went on for a long time , and they could not get away from the palace , so they were all in great trouble .
12 Then the sheriff said -LRB- for he too had been bidden to the wedding at Court -RRB- : `` Yonder away in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that she uses to make up her fire I know very well that it will hold fast . ''
13 So they sent off a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused ; so now they had a trace-pin which would not snap in two .
14 But all at once , just as they were starting , the bottom of the coach fell in pieces .
15 They made a new bottom as fast as they could , but , no matter how they nailed it together , or what kind of wood they used , no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again , so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin .
16 Then the attorney said , for he too was at the wedding in the palace : `` Away there in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you could but get her to lend you one-half of her porch-door I am certain that it will hold together . ''
17 So they again sent a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily for the loan of the gilded porch-door of which the attorney had told them that they got it at once .
18 They were just setting out again , but now the horses were not able to draw the coach .
19 They had six horses already , and now they put in eight , and then ten , and then twelve , but the more they put in , and the more the coachman whipped them , the less good it did ; and the coach never stirred from the spot .
20 It was already beginning to be late in the day , and to church they must and would go , so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress .
21 Then the bailiff spoke up and said : `` Out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl , and if you could but get her to lend you her XXXXX I know it could draw the coach , even if it were as heavy as a mountain .

2 `` Tell me when you have got hold of the calf 's tail , '' said the Master-maid .

4 `` Then may you hold the calf 's tail , and the calf 's tail hold you , and may you go round the world together till day dawns ! ''
5 said the Master-maid .
6 So the bailiff had to bestir himself , for the calf went over rough and smooth , over hill and dale , and , the more the bailiff cried and screamed , the faster the calf went .
7 When daylight began to appear , the bailiff was half dead ; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf 's tail , that he forgot the sack of money and all else .
8 He walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done , but , the slower he went , the more time had everyone to stare and look at him ; and they used it too , and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf .

21 When they had seated themselves at the table the Prince who had been in service with the giant said that he thought they ought to have invited the XXXXX who had lent them the shovel-handle , and the porch-door , and the calf up to the palace , `` for , '' said he , `` if we had not got these three things , we should never have got away from the palace .

1 So the bailiff had to bestir himself , for the calf went over rough and smooth , over hill and dale , and , the more the bailiff cried and screamed , the faster the calf went .
2 When daylight began to appear , the bailiff was half dead ; and so glad was he to leave loose of the calf 's tail , that he forgot the sack of money and all else .
3 He walked now slowly -- more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had done , but , the slower he went , the more time had everyone to stare and look at him ; and they used it too , and no one can imagine how tired out and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf .
4 On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King 's palace , and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride , and the brother who had been with the giant with her sister .
5 But when they had seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the palace one of the trace-pins broke , and , though they made one , two , and three to put in its place , that did not help them , for each broke in turn , no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of .
6 This went on for a long time , and they could not get away from the palace , so they were all in great trouble .
7 Then the sheriff said -LRB- for he too had been bidden to the wedding at Court -RRB- : `` Yonder away in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that she uses to make up her fire I know very well that it will hold fast . ''
8 So they sent off a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused ; so now they had a trace-pin which would not snap in two .
9 But all at once , just as they were starting , the bottom of the coach fell in pieces .
10 They made a new bottom as fast as they could , but , no matter how they nailed it together , or what kind of wood they used , no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again , so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin .
11 Then the attorney said , for he too was at the wedding in the palace : `` Away there in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you could but get her to lend you one-half of her porch-door I am certain that it will hold together . ''
12 So they again sent a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily for the loan of the gilded porch-door of which the attorney had told them that they got it at once .
13 They were just setting out again , but now the horses were not able to draw the coach .
14 They had six horses already , and now they put in eight , and then ten , and then twelve , but the more they put in , and the more the coachman whipped them , the less good it did ; and the coach never stirred from the spot .
15 It was already beginning to be late in the day , and to church they must and would go , so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress .
16 Then the bailiff spoke up and said : `` Out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl , and if you could but get her to lend you her calf I know it could draw the coach , even if it were as heavy as a mountain . ''
17 They all thought that it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf , but there was nothing else for it but to send a messenger once more , and beg as prettily as they could , on behalf of the King , that she would let them have the loan of the calf that the bailiff had told them about .
18 The Master-maid let them have it immediately -- this time also she would not say `` no . ''

18 The King also thought that this was both just and proper , so he sent five of his best men down to the gilded hut , to greet the maiden courteously from the King , and to beg her to be so good as to come up to the palace to dinner at mid-day .
19 `` Greet the King , and tell him that , if he is too good to come to me , I am too good to come to him , '' replied the Master-maid .
20 So the King had to go himself , and the Master-maid went with him immediately , and , as the King believed that she was more than she appeared to be , he seated her in the place of honor by the youngest bridegroom .
21 When they had sat at the table for a short time , the Master-maid took out the cock , and the hen , and the golden apple which she had brought away with her from the XXXXX 's house , and set them on the table in front of her , and instantly the cock and the hen began to fight with each other for the golden apple .	giant		attorney|bailiff|cottage|day|giant|girl|horses|matter|turn|wedding

1 Then the sheriff said -LRB- for he too had been bidden to the wedding at Court -RRB- : `` Yonder away in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that she uses to make up her fire I know very well that it will hold fast . ''
2 So they sent off a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily that they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had spoken that they were not refused ; so now they had a trace-pin which would not snap in two .
3 But all at once , just as they were starting , the bottom of the coach fell in pieces .
4 They made a new bottom as fast as they could , but , no matter how they nailed it together , or what kind of wood they used , no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again , so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin .

8 They had six horses already , and now they put in eight , and then ten , and then twelve , but the more they put in , and the more the coachman whipped them , the less good it did ; and the coach never stirred from the spot .

10 Then the bailiff spoke up and said : `` Out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl , and if you could but get her to lend you her calf I know it could draw the coach , even if it were as heavy as a mountain . ''
11 They all thought that it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf , but there was nothing else for it but to send a messenger once more , and beg as prettily as they could , on behalf of the King , that she would let them have the loan of the calf that the bailiff had told them about .
12 The Master-maid let them have it immediately -- this time also she would not say `` no . ''
13 Then they harnessed the calf to see if the coach would move ; and away it went , over rough and smooth , over stock and stone , so that they could scarcely breathe , and sometimes they were on the ground , and sometimes up in the air ; and when they came to the church the coach began to go round and round like a spinning-wheel , and it was with the utmost difficulty and danger that they were able to get out of the coach and into the church .
14 And when they went back again the coach went quicker still , so that most of them did not know how they got back to the palace at all .

5 They had six horses already , and now they put in eight , and then ten , and then twelve , but the more they put in , and the more the coachman whipped them , the less good it did ; and the coach never stirred from the spot .
6 It was already beginning to be late in the day , and to church they must and would go , so everyone who was in the palace was in a state of distress .
7 Then the bailiff spoke up and said : `` Out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl , and if you could but get her to lend you her calf I know it could draw the coach , even if it were as heavy as a mountain . ''
8 They all thought that it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf , but there was nothing else for it but to send a messenger once more , and beg as prettily as they could , on behalf of the King , that she would let them have the loan of the calf that the bailiff had told them about .
9 The Master-maid let them have it immediately -- this time also she would not say `` no . ''
10 Then they harnessed the calf to see if the coach would move ; and away it went , over rough and smooth , over stock and stone , so that they could scarcely breathe , and sometimes they were on the ground , and sometimes up in the air ; and when they came to the church the coach began to go round and round like a spinning-wheel , and it was with the utmost difficulty and danger that they were able to get out of the coach and into the church .
11 And when they went back again the coach went quicker still , so that most of them did not know how they got back to the palace at all .
12 When they had seated themselves at the table the Prince who had been in service with the giant said that he thought they ought to have invited the maiden who had lent them the shovel-handle , and the porch-door , and the calf up to the palace , `` for , '' said he , `` if we had not got these three things , we should never have got away from the palace . ''
13 The King also thought that this was both just and proper , so he sent five of his best men down to the gilded hut , to greet the maiden courteously from the King , and to beg her to be so good as to come up to the palace to dinner at mid-day .
14 `` Greet the King , and tell him that , if he is too good to come to me , I am too good to come to him , '' replied the Master-maid .
15 So the King had to go himself , and the Master-maid went with him immediately , and , as the King believed that she was more than she appeared to be , he seated her in the place of honor by the youngest bridegroom .
16 When they had sat at the table for a short time , the Master-maid took out the cock , and the hen , and the golden apple which she had brought away with her from the giant 's house , and set them on the table in front of her , and instantly the cock and the hen began to fight with each other for the golden apple .
17 `` Oh !
18 look how those two there are fighting for the golden apple , '' said the King 's son .
19 `` Yes , and so did we two fight to get out that time when we were in the mountain , '' said the Master-maid .
20 So the Prince knew her again , and you may imagine how delighted he was .
21 He ordered the troll-witch who had rolled the apple to him to be torn in pieces between four-and-twenty horses , so that not a bit of her was left , and then for the first time they began really to keep the wedding , and , weary as they were , the sheriff , the XXXXX , and the bailiff kept it up too .	attorney		air|attorney|bottom|giant|horses|service|table|things|time|wedding

1 They made a new bottom as fast as they could , but , no matter how they nailed it together , or what kind of wood they used , no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again , so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin .
2 Then the attorney said , for he too was at the wedding in the palace : `` Away there in the thicket dwells a maiden , and if you could but get her to lend you one-half of her porch-door I am certain that it will hold together . ''
3 So they again sent a messenger to the thicket , and begged so prettily for the loan of the gilded porch-door of which the attorney had told them that they got it at once .
4 They were just setting out again , but now the horses were not able to draw the coach .

13 WHY THE SEA IS SALT Once upon a time , long , long ago , there were two brothers , the one rich and the other poor .

15 It was by no means the first time that the brother had been forced to give something to him , and he was not better pleased at being asked now than he generally was .

3 `` Greet the King , and tell him that , if he is too good to come to me , I am too good to come to him , '' replied the Master-maid .
4 So the King had to go himself , and the Master-maid went with him immediately , and , as the King believed that she was more than she appeared to be , he seated her in the place of honor by the youngest bridegroom .
5 When they had sat at the table for a short time , the Master-maid took out the cock , and the hen , and the golden apple which she had brought away with her from the giant 's house , and set them on the table in front of her , and instantly the cock and the hen began to fight with each other for the golden apple .

5 `` There you see what has brought me all my wealth ! ''
6 said he , and brought out the mill , and made it grind first one thing and then another .
7 When the brother saw that , he insisted on having the mill , and after a great deal of persuasion got it ; but he had to give three hundred dollars for it , and the poor brother was to keep it till the haymaking was over , for he thought : `` If I keep it as long as that , I can make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long year . ''
8 During that time you may imagine that the mill did not grow rusty , and when hay-harvest came the rich brother got it , but the other had taken good care not to teach him how to stop it .

10 So , when dinner-time drew near , he set the mill on the kitchen-table , and said : `` Grind herrings and milk pottage , and do it both quickly and well . ''
11 So the mill began to grind herrings and milk pottage , and first all the dishes and tubs were filled , and then it came out all over the kitchen-floor .
12 The man twisted and turned it , and did all he could to make the mill stop , but , howsoever he turned it and screwed it , the mill went on grinding , and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the man was like to be drowned .
13 So he threw open the parlor door , but it was not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too , and it was with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the door-latch .
14 When he got the door open , he did not stay long in the room , but ran out , and the herrings and pottage came after him , and it streamed out over both farm and field .
15 Now the old woman , who was out spreading the hay , began to think dinner was long in coming , and said to the women and the mowers : `` Though the master does not call us home , we may as well go .
16 It may be that he finds he is not good at making pottage and I should do well to help him . ''
17 So they began to straggle homeward , but when they had got a little way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread , all pouring forth and winding about one over the other , and the man himself in front of the flood .
18 `` Would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs !
19 Take care that you are not drowned in the pottage ! ''
20 he cried as he went by them as if Mischief were at his heels , down to where his brother dwelt .
21 Then he begged him , for God 's XXXXX , to take the mill back again , and that in an instant , for , said he : `` If it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage . ''	sake		brother|dinner|dishes|mill|point|riches|room|sake|time|wealth

3 So , when dinner-time drew near , he set the mill on the kitchen-table , and said : `` Grind herrings and milk pottage , and do it both quickly and well . ''
4 So the mill began to grind herrings and milk pottage , and first all the dishes and tubs were filled , and then it came out all over the kitchen-floor .
5 The man twisted and turned it , and did all he could to make the mill stop , but , howsoever he turned it and screwed it , the mill went on grinding , and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the man was like to be drowned .
6 So he threw open the parlor door , but it was not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too , and it was with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the door-latch .
7 When he got the door open , he did not stay long in the room , but ran out , and the herrings and pottage came after him , and it streamed out over both farm and field .
8 Now the old woman , who was out spreading the hay , began to think dinner was long in coming , and said to the women and the mowers : `` Though the master does not call us home , we may as well go .
9 It may be that he finds he is not good at making pottage and I should do well to help him . ''
10 So they began to straggle homeward , but when they had got a little way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread , all pouring forth and winding about one over the other , and the man himself in front of the flood .
11 `` Would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs !
12 Take care that you are not drowned in the pottage ! ''
13 he cried as he went by them as if Mischief were at his heels , down to where his brother dwelt .
14 Then he begged him , for God 's sake , to take the mill back again , and that in an instant , for , said he : `` If it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage . ''
15 But the brother would not take it until the other paid him three hundred dollars , and that he was obliged to do .
16 Now the poor brother had both the money and the mill again .
17 So it was not long before he had a farmhouse much finer than that in which his brother lived , but the mill ground him so much money that he covered it with plates of gold ; and the farmhouse lay close by the sea-shore , so it shone and glittered far out to sea .
18 Everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man in the gold farmhouse , and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill , for the report of it spread far and wide , and there was no one who had not heard tell of it .
19 After a long , long time came also a skipper who wished to see the mill .
20 He asked if it could make salt .
21 `` Yes , it could make XXXXX , '' said he who owned it , and when the skipper heard that , he wished with all his might and main to have the mill , let it cost what it might , for , he thought , if he had it , he would get off having to sail far away over the perilous sea for freights of salt .	salt		Mischief|door|farm|master|milk|room|sake|salt|skipper|tubs

3 The man twisted and turned it , and did all he could to make the mill stop , but , howsoever he turned it and screwed it , the mill went on grinding , and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the man was like to be drowned .
4 So he threw open the parlor door , but it was not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too , and it was with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of pottage and get hold of the door-latch .
5 When he got the door open , he did not stay long in the room , but ran out , and the herrings and pottage came after him , and it streamed out over both farm and field .
6 Now the old woman , who was out spreading the hay , began to think dinner was long in coming , and said to the women and the mowers : `` Though the master does not call us home , we may as well go .
7 It may be that he finds he is not good at making pottage and I should do well to help him . ''
8 So they began to straggle homeward , but when they had got a little way up the hill they met the herrings and pottage and bread , all pouring forth and winding about one over the other , and the man himself in front of the flood .
9 `` Would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs !
10 Take care that you are not drowned in the pottage ! ''
11 he cried as he went by them as if Mischief were at his heels , down to where his brother dwelt .
12 Then he begged him , for God 's sake , to take the mill back again , and that in an instant , for , said he : `` If it grind one hour more the whole district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage . ''
13 But the brother would not take it until the other paid him three hundred dollars , and that he was obliged to do .
14 Now the poor brother had both the money and the mill again .
15 So it was not long before he had a farmhouse much finer than that in which his brother lived , but the mill ground him so much money that he covered it with plates of gold ; and the farmhouse lay close by the sea-shore , so it shone and glittered far out to sea .
16 Everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man in the gold farmhouse , and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill , for the report of it spread far and wide , and there was no one who had not heard tell of it .
17 After a long , long time came also a skipper who wished to see the mill .
18 He asked if it could make salt .
19 `` Yes , it could make salt , '' said he who owned it , and when the skipper heard that , he wished with all his might and main to have the mill , let it cost what it might , for , he thought , if he had it , he would get off having to sail far away over the perilous sea for freights of salt .
20 At first the man would not hear of parting with it , but the skipper begged and prayed , and at last the man sold it to him , and got many , many thousand dollars for it .
21 When the skipper had got the mill on his back he did not stay there long , for he was so afraid that the man would change his mind , and he had no XXXXX to ask how he was to stop it grinding , but got on board his ship as fast as he could .	time		Everyone|Mischief|dishes|hay|heaven|heels|instant|mill|time|women

3 At first the man would not hear of parting with it , but the skipper begged and prayed , and at last the man sold it to him , and got many , many thousand dollars for it .
4 When the skipper had got the mill on his back he did not stay there long , for he was so afraid that the man would change his mind , and he had no time to ask how he was to stop it grinding , but got on board his ship as fast as he could .
5 When he had gone a little way out to sea he took the mill on deck .
6 `` Grind salt , and grind both quickly and well , '' said the skipper .

1 While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river , the Cat came up to the coach and told the King that , while his master was washing , there came by some rogues , who went off with his clothes , though he had cried out : `` Thieves !
2 thieves ! ''
3 several times , as loud as he could .
4 This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone .
5 The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas .
6 The King caressed him after a very extraordinary manner , and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien -LRB- for he was well made and very handsome in his person -RRB- , the King 's daughter took a secret inclination to him , and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love with him to distraction .
7 The King would needs have him come into the coach and take part of the airing .
8 The Cat , quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed , marched on before , and , meeting with some countrymen , who were mowing a meadow , he said to them : `` Good people , you who are mowing , if you do not tell the King that the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas , you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot . ''
9 The King did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged .
10 `` To my Lord Marquis of Carabas , '' answered they altogether , for the Cat 's threats had made them terribly afraid .
11 `` You see , sir , '' said the Marquis , `` this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year . ''
12 The Master Cat , who went still on before , met with some reapers , and said to them : `` Good people , you who are reaping , if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas , you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot . ''
13 The King , who passed by a moment after , would needs know to whom all that corn , which he then saw , did belong .
14 `` To my Lord Marquis of Carabas , '' replied the reapers , and the King was very well pleased with it , as well as the Marquis , whom he congratulated thereupon .
15 The Master Cat , who went always before , said the same words to all he met , and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas .
16 Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle , the master of which was an ogre , the richest had ever been known ; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle .
17 The Cat , who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do , asked to speak with him , saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him .
18 The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do , and made him sit down .
19 `` I have been assured , '' said the Cat , `` that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to ; you can , for example , transform yourself into a lion , or elephant , and the like . ''
20 `` That is true , '' answered the ogre very briskly ; `` and to convince you , you shall see me now become a lion . ''
21 Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a XXXXX so near him that he immediately got into the gutter , not without abundance of trouble and danger , because of his boots , which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles .	lion		coach|herbs|lands|lion|moment|project|respects|river|stone|suits

1 Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle , the master of which was an ogre , the richest had ever been known ; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle .
2 The Cat , who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do , asked to speak with him , saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him .
3 The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do , and made him sit down .
4 `` I have been assured , '' said the Cat , `` that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to ; you can , for example , transform yourself into a lion , or elephant , and the like . ''
5 `` That is true , '' answered the ogre very briskly ; `` and to convince you , you shall see me now become a lion . ''
6 Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he immediately got into the gutter , not without abundance of trouble and danger , because of his boots , which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles .
7 A little while after , when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form , he came down , and owned he had been very much frightened .
8 `` I have been , moreover , informed , '' said the Cat , `` but I know not how to believe it , that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals ; for example , to change yourself into a rat or a mouse ; but I must own to you I take this to be impossible . ''
9 `` Impossible ! ''
10 cried the ogre ; `` you shall see that presently . ''
11 And at the same time he changed himself into a mouse , and began to run about the floor .
12 Puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and ate him up .
13 Meanwhile the King , who saw , as he passed , this fine castle of the ogre 's , had a mind to go into it .
14 Puss , who heard the noise of his Majesty 's coach running over the draw-bridge , ran out , and said to the King : `` Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas . ''

1 When she saw the unlucky cabbage Felicia was much distressed , and did not know what to do ; but at last she ran back to the fountain , and , kneeling before the Queen , said : `` Madam , Bruno has stolen my pot of pinks , so I have nothing but my silver ring ; but I beg you to accept it as a proof of my gratitude . ''
2 `` But if I take your ring , my pretty shepherdess , '' said the Queen , `` you will have nothing left ; and what will you do then ? ''
3 `` Ah !

5 So the Queen took the ring and put it on her finger , and mounted her chariot , which was made of coral studded with emeralds , and drawn by six milk-white horses .

11 As soon as it was light , Felicia , who was very unhappy about her pot of pinks , went out to look for it , and the first thing she found was the unfortunate cabbage .
12 She gave it a push with her foot , saying : `` What are you doing here , and how dared you put yourself in the place of my pot of pinks ? ''
13 `` If I had n't been carried , '' replied the cabbage , `` you may be very sure that I should n't have thought of going there . ''
14 It made her shiver with fright to hear the cabbage talk , but he went on : `` If you will be good enough to plant me by my comrades again , I can tell you where your pinks are at this moment -- hidden in Bruno 's bed ! ''
15 Felicia was in despair when she heard this , not knowing how she was to get them back .
16 But she replanted the cabbage very kindly in his old place , and , as she finished doing it , she saw Bruno 's hen , and said , catching hold of it : `` Come here , horrid little creature !
17 you shall suffer for all the unkind things my brother has done to me . ''

1 But she replanted the cabbage very kindly in his old place , and , as she finished doing it , she saw Bruno 's hen , and said , catching hold of it : `` Come here , horrid little creature !
2 you shall suffer for all the unkind things my brother has done to me . ''
3 `` Ah !
4 shepherdess , '' said the hen , `` do n't kill me ; I am rather a gossip , and I can tell you some surprising things that you will like to hear .
5 Do n't imagine that you are the daughter of the poor laborer who brought you up ; your mother was a queen who had six girls already , and the King threatened that unless she had a son who could inherit his kingdom she should have her head cut off .
6 `` So when the Queen had another little daughter she was quite frightened , and agreed with her sister -LRB- who was a fairy -RRB- to exchange her for the fairy 's little son .
7 Now the Queen had been shut up in a great tower by the King 's orders , and when a great many days went by and still she heard nothing from the Fairy she made her escape from the window by means of a rope ladder , taking her little baby with her .
8 After wandering about until she was half dead with cold and fatigue she reached this cottage .
9 I was the laborer 's wife , and was a good nurse , and the Queen gave you into my charge , and told me all her misfortunes , and then died before she had time to say what was to become of you .
10 `` As I never in all my life could keep a secret , I could not help telling this strange tale to my neighbors , and one day a beautiful lady came here , and I told it to her also .
11 When I had finished she touched me with a wand she held in her hand , and instantly I became a hen , and there was an end of my talking !
12 I was very sad , and my husband , who was out when it happened , never knew what had become of me .
13 After seeking me everywhere he believed that I must have been drowned , or eaten up by wild beasts in the forest .
14 That same lady came here once more , and commanded that you should be called Felicia , and left the ring and the pot of pinks to be given to you ; and while she was in the house twenty-five of the King 's guards came to search for you , doubtless meaning to kill you ; but she muttered a few words , and immediately they all turned into cabbages .
15 It was one of them whom you threw out of your window yesterday .

18 That she did not succeed in doing ; so now , my dear Felicia , if you will be married to my son with this silver ring your future happiness is certain .
19 Do you think him handsome and amiable enough to be willing to marry him ? ''
20 `` Madam , '' replied Felicia , blushing , `` you overwhelm me with your kindness .
21 I know that you are my XXXXX 's sister , and that by your art you turned the soldiers who were sent to kill me into cabbages , and my nurse into a hen , and that you do me only too much honor in proposing that I shall marry your son .	mother		Madam|Whereupon|aid|care|child|fairy|man|mother|nothing|upbringing

1 `` What ! ''
2 said the Queen , `` have you not heard that you are a Princess ? ''
3 `` I was told so a little while ago , madam , but how could I believe it without a single proof ? ''
4 `` Ah !
5 dear child , '' said the Queen , `` the way you speak assures me that , in spite of your humble upbringing , you are indeed a real princess , and I can save you from being treated in such a way again . ''
6 She was interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a very handsome young man .
7 He wore a coat of green velvet fastened with emerald clasps , and had a crown of pinks on his head .
8 He knelt upon one knee and kissed the Queen 's hand .
9 `` Ah ! ''
10 she cried , `` my pink , my dear son , what a happiness to see you restored to your natural shape by Felicia 's aid ! ''
11 And she embraced him joyfully .
12 Then , turning to Felicia , she said : `` Charming Princess , I know all the hen told you , but you can not have heard that the zephyrs , to whom was entrusted the task of carrying my son to the tower where the Queen , your mother , so anxiously waited for him , left him instead in a garden of flowers , while they flew off to tell your mother .
13 Whereupon a fairy with whom I had quarrelled changed him into a pink , and I could do nothing to prevent it .
14 `` You can imagine how angry I was , and how I tried to find some means of undoing the mischief she had done ; but there was no help for it .
15 I could only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up , hoping that when you grew up he might love you , and by your care be restored to his natural form .
16 And you see everything has come right , as I hoped it would .
