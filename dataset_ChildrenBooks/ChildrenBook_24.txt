5 Then she left the tower and drove the geese into a field .
6 And when they had reached the common where the geese fed she sat down and unloosed her hair , which was of pure gold .
7 Curdken loved to see it glitter in the sun , and wanted much to pull some hair out .
8 Then she spoke : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold , Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
9 Then a gust of wind blew Curdken 's hat away , and he had to chase it over hill and dale .
10 When he returned from the pursuit she had finished her combing and curling , and his chance of getting any hair was gone .
11 Curdken was very angry , and would n't speak to her .
12 So they herded the geese till evening and then went home .

15 Then she went on her way till she came to the common , where she sat down and began to comb out her hair ; then Curdken ran up to her and wanted to grasp some of the hair from her head , but she called out hastily : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold , Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
16 Then a puff of wind came and blew Curdken 's hat far away , so that he had to run after it ; and when he returned she had long finished putting up her golden locks , and he could n't get any hair ; so they watched the geese till it was dark .
17 But that evening when they got home Curdken went to the old King , and said : `` I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl . ''
18 `` For what reason ? ''
19 asked the old King .
20 `` Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long , '' replied Curdken ; and he proceeded to relate all her iniquities , and said : `` Every morning as we drive the flock through the dark gate she says to a horse 's head that hangs on the wall : '' ` Oh !

2 And when they had reached the common where the geese fed she sat down and unloosed her hair , which was of pure gold .
3 Curdken loved to see it glitter in the sun , and wanted much to pull some hair out .
4 Then she spoke : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold , Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
5 Then a gust of wind blew Curdken 's hat away , and he had to chase it over hill and dale .
6 When he returned from the pursuit she had finished her combing and curling , and his chance of getting any hair was gone .
7 Curdken was very angry , and would n't speak to her .
8 So they herded the geese till evening and then went home .

10 Falada , 't is you hang there ; '' and the head replied : '' 'T is you ; pass under , Princess fair : If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ''
11 Then she went on her way till she came to the common , where she sat down and began to comb out her hair ; then Curdken ran up to her and wanted to grasp some of the hair from her head , but she called out hastily : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold , Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
12 Then a puff of wind came and blew Curdken 's hat far away , so that he had to run after it ; and when he returned she had long finished putting up her golden locks , and he could n't get any hair ; so they watched the geese till it was dark .
13 But that evening when they got home Curdken went to the old King , and said : `` I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl . ''
14 `` For what reason ? ''
15 asked the old King .
16 `` Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long , '' replied Curdken ; and he proceeded to relate all her iniquities , and said : `` Every morning as we drive the flock through the dark gate she says to a horse 's head that hangs on the wall : '' ` Oh !
17 Falada , 't is you hang there ' ; and the head replies : '' '' Tis you ; pass under , Princess fair : If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ' ''
18 And Curdken went on to tell what passed on the common where the geese fed , and how he had always to chase his hat .
19 The old King bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day ; and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark gate , and heard how the goose-girl greeted Falada .
20 Then he followed her through the field , and hid himself behind a bush on the common .
21 He soon saw with his own eyes how the goose-boy and the goose-girl looked after the geese , and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her XXXXX , that glittered like gold , and repeated : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown .

9 Then she went on her way till she came to the common , where she sat down and began to comb out her hair ; then Curdken ran up to her and wanted to grasp some of the hair from her head , but she called out hastily : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold , Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown .

10 Then a puff of wind came and blew Curdken 's hat far away , so that he had to run after it ; and when he returned she had long finished putting up her golden locks , and he could n't get any hair ; so they watched the geese till it was dark .
11 But that evening when they got home Curdken went to the old King , and said : `` I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl . ''
12 `` For what reason ? ''
13 asked the old King .
14 `` Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long , '' replied Curdken ; and he proceeded to relate all her iniquities , and said : `` Every morning as we drive the flock through the dark gate she says to a horse 's head that hangs on the wall : '' ` Oh !
15 Falada , 't is you hang there ' ; and the head replies : '' '' Tis you ; pass under , Princess fair : If your mother only knew , Her heart would surely break in two . ' ''
16 And Curdken went on to tell what passed on the common where the geese fed , and how he had always to chase his hat .
17 The old King bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day ; and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark gate , and heard how the goose-girl greeted Falada .
18 Then he followed her through the field , and hid himself behind a bush on the common .
19 He soon saw with his own eyes how the goose-boy and the goose-girl looked after the geese , and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her hair , that glittered like gold , and repeated : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
20 Then a gust of wind came and blew Curdken 's hat away , so that he had to fly over hill and dale after it , and the girl in the meantime quietly combed and plaited her hair : all this the old King observed , and returned to the palace without anyone having noticed him .

1 When he returned from the pursuit she had finished her combing and curling , and his chance of getting any hair was gone .

6 The old King bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day ; and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark gate , and heard how the goose-girl greeted Falada .
7 Then he followed her through the field , and hid himself behind a bush on the common .
8 He soon saw with his own eyes how the goose-boy and the goose-girl looked after the geese , and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her hair , that glittered like gold , and repeated : `` Wind , wind , gently sway , Blow Curdken 's hat away ; Let him chase o'er field and wold Till my locks of ruddy gold Now astray and hanging down , Be combed and plaited in a crown . ''
9 Then a gust of wind came and blew Curdken 's hat away , so that he had to fly over hill and dale after it , and the girl in the meantime quietly combed and plaited her hair : all this the old King observed , and returned to the palace without anyone having noticed him .
10 In the evening when the goose-girl came home he called her aside , and asked her why she behaved as she did .
11 `` I may not tell you why ; how dare I confide my woes to anyone ?
12 for I swore not to by heaven , otherwise I should have lost my life . ''
13 The old King begged her to tell him all , and left her no peace , but he could get nothing out of her .
14 At last he said : `` Well , if you wo n't tell me , confide your trouble to the iron stove there , '' and he went away .
15 Then she crept to the stove , and began to sob and cry and to pour out her poor little heart , and said : `` Here I sit , deserted by all the world , I who am a king 's daughter , and a false waiting-maid has forced me to take off my own clothes , and has taken my place with my bridegroom , while I have to fulfill the lowly office of goose-girl .
16 `` If my mother only knew Her heart would surely break in two . ''
17 But the old King stood outside at the stove chimney , and listened to her words .
18 Then he entered the room again , and bidding her leave the stove , he ordered royal apparel to be put on her , in which she looked amazingly lovely .
19 Then he summoned his son , and revealed to him that he had got the false bride , who was nothing but a waiting-maid , while the real one , in the guise of the ex-goose-girl , was standing at his side .
20 The young King rejoiced from his heart when he saw her beauty and learned how good she was , and a great banquet was prepared , to which everyone was bidden .
21 The bridegroom sat at the XXXXX of the table , the Princess on one side of him and the waiting-maid on the other ; but she was so dazzled that she did not recognize the Princess in her glittering garments .	head		banquet|bride|daughter|field|head|horse|iniquities|maiden|place|trouble

11 The King stroked it gently , and said to it : `` Well , bunny , as you have come to me for protection I will see that nobody hurts you . ''
12 And he took it home to his palace and had it put in a pretty little house , with all sorts of nice things to eat .
13 That night , when he was alone in his room , a beautiful lady suddenly appeared before him ; her long dress was as white as snow , and she had a crown of white roses upon her head .
14 The good King was very much surprised to see her , for he knew his door had been tightly shut , and he could not think how she had got in .
15 But she said to him : `` I am the Fairy Truth .
16 I was passing through the wood when you were out hunting , and I wished to find out if you were really good , as everybody said you were , so I took the shape of a little rabbit and came to your arms for shelter , for I know that those who are merciful to animals will be still kinder to their fellow-men .
17 If you had refused to help me I should have been certain that you were wicked .
18 I thank you for the kindness you have shown me , which has made me your friend for ever .
19 You have only to ask me for anything you want and I promise that I will give it to you . ''
20 `` Madam , '' said the good King , `` since you are a fairy you no doubt know all my wishes .
21 I have but one XXXXX whom I love very dearly , that is why he is called Prince Darling .	son		Madam|bunny|door|home|house|mamma|son|sorts|wishes|wretch

1 The King 's son , then on his return from hunting , met her , and seeing her so very pretty , asked her what she did there alone and why she cried .
2 `` Alas !
3 sir , my mamma has turned me out of doors . ''
4 The King 's son , who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth , desired her to tell him how that happened .
5 She thereupon told him the whole story ; and so the King 's son fell in love with her , and , considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion , conducted her to the palace of the King his father , and there married her .
6 As for the sister , she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her off ; and the miserable wretch , having wandered about a good while without finding anybody to take her in , went to a corner of the wood , and there died .

5 The Prince saw how naughty he had been , and promised to try and do better in future , but he did not keep his word .
6 The fact was he had been brought up by a foolish nurse , who had spoiled him when he was little .
7 If he wanted anything he only had to cry and fret and stamp his feet and she would give him whatever he asked for , which had made him self-willed ; also she had told him from morning to night that he would one day be a king , and that kings were very happy , because everyone was bound to obey and respect them , and no one could prevent them from doing just as they liked .
8 When the Prince grew old enough to understand , he soon learned that there could be nothing worse than to be proud , obstinate , and conceited , and he had really tried to cure himself of these defects , but by that time all his faults had become habits ; and a bad habit is very hard to get rid of .
9 Not that he was naturally of a bad disposition ; he was truly sorry when he had been naughty , and said : `` I am very unhappy to have to struggle against my anger and pride every day ; if I had been punished for them when I was little they would not be such a trouble to me now . ''
10 His ring pricked him very often , and sometimes he left off what he was doing at once ; but at other times he would not attend to it .
11 Strangely enough , it gave him only a slight prick for a trifling fault , but when he was really naughty it made his finger actually bleed .
12 At last he got tired of being constantly reminded , and wanted to be able to do as he liked , so he threw his ring aside , and thought himself the happiest of men to have got rid of its teasing pricks .
13 He gave himself up to doing every foolish thing that occurred to him , until he became quite wicked and nobody could like him any longer .
14 One day , when the Prince was walking about , he saw a young girl who was so very pretty that he made up his mind at once that he would marry her .
15 Her name was Celia , and she was as good as she was beautiful .
16 Prince Darling fancied that Celia would think herself only too happy if he offered to make her a great queen , but she said fearlessly : `` Sire , I am only a shepherdess , and a poor girl , but , nevertheless , I will not marry you . ''
17 `` Do you dislike me ? ''
18 asked the Prince , who was very much vexed at this answer .
19 `` No , my Prince , '' replied Celia ; `` I can not help thinking you very handsome ; but what good would riches be to me , and all the grand dresses and splendid carriages that you would give me , if the bad deeds which I should see you do every day made me hate and despise you ? ''
20 The Prince was very angry at this speech , and commanded his officers to make Celia a prisoner and carry her off to his palace .

1 `` Do you dislike me ? ''
2 asked the Prince , who was very much vexed at this answer .
3 `` No , my Prince , '' replied Celia ; `` I can not help thinking you very handsome ; but what good would riches be to me , and all the grand dresses and splendid carriages that you would give me , if the bad deeds which I should see you do every day made me hate and despise you ? ''
4 The Prince was very angry at this speech , and commanded his officers to make Celia a prisoner and carry her off to his palace .
5 All day long the remembrance of what she had said annoyed him , but as he loved her he could not make up his mind to have her punished .
6 One of the Prince 's favorite companions was his foster-brother , whom he trusted entirely ; but he was not at all a good man , and gave Prince Darling very bad advice , and encouraged him in all his evil ways .
7 When he saw the Prince so downcast he asked what was the matter , and when he explained that he could not bear Celia 's bad opinion of him , and was resolved to be a better man in order to please her , this evil adviser said to him : `` You are very kind to trouble yourself about this little girl ; if I were you I would soon make her obey me .
8 Remember that you are a king , and that it would be laughable to see you trying to please a shepherdess , who ought to be only too glad to be one of your slaves .
9 Keep her in prison , and feed her on bread and water for a little while , and then , if she still says she will not marry you , have her head cut off , to teach other people that you mean to be obeyed .
10 Why , if you can not make a girl like that do as you wish , your subjects will soon forget that they are only put into this world for our pleasure . ''
11 `` But , '' said Prince Darling , `` would it not be a shame if I had an innocent girl put to death ?

2 But when he reached the room in which Celia had been locked up , he was greatly surprised to find that she was not in it , though he had the key in his own pocket all the time .

17 Prince Darling recognized the voice of the Fairy Truth and turned in a fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could ; but he saw no one , and the same voice went on : `` I laugh at your powerlessness and anger , and I intend to punish your pride by letting you fall into the hands of your own subjects .

19 So he ran toward the wood , but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears , and the hunters , who were hiding in a tree , leaped down , and secured him with several chains , and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom .
20 On the way , instead of recognizing that his own faults had brought this punishment upon him , he accused the Fairy of being the cause of all his misfortunes , and bit and tore at his chains furiously .

5 After giving this order he went to his own room , but he had scarcely got into it when there was a clap of thunder which made the ground shake , and the Fairy Truth appeared suddenly before him .

3 You have despised my counsel , and have gone your own evil way until you are only outwardly a man ; really you are a monster -- the horror of everyone who knows you .
4 It is time that I should fulfil my promise , and begin your punishment .
5 I condemn you to resemble the animals whose ways you have imitated .
6 You have made yourself like the lion by your anger , and like the wolf by your greediness .
7 Like a snake , you have ungratefully turned upon one who was a second father to you ; your churlishness has made you like a bull .
8 Therefore , in your new form , take the appearance of all these animals . ''
9 The Fairy had scarcely finished speaking when Prince Darling saw to his horror that her words were fulfilled .
10 He had a lion 's head , a bull 's horns , a wolf 's feet , and a snake 's body .
11 At the same instant he found himself in a great forest , beside a clear lake , in which he could see plainly the horrible creature he had become , and a voice said to him : `` Look carefully at the state to which your wickedness has brought you ; believe me , your soul is a thousand times more hideous than your body . ''
12 Prince Darling recognized the voice of the Fairy Truth and turned in a fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could ; but he saw no one , and the same voice went on : `` I laugh at your powerlessness and anger , and I intend to punish your pride by letting you fall into the hands of your own subjects . ''
13 The Prince began to think that the best thing he could do would be to get as far away from the lake as he could , then at least he would not be continually reminded of his terrible ugliness .
14 So he ran toward the wood , but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears , and the hunters , who were hiding in a tree , leaped down , and secured him with several chains , and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom .
15 On the way , instead of recognizing that his own faults had brought this punishment upon him , he accused the Fairy of being the cause of all his misfortunes , and bit and tore at his chains furiously .
16 As they approached the town he saw that some great rejoicing was being held , and when the hunters asked what had happened they were told that the Prince , whose only pleasure it was to torment his people , had been found in his room , killed by a thunder-bolt -LRB- for that was what was supposed to have become of him -RRB- .
17 Four of his courtiers , those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings , had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them , but the people , who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the Prince , had cut off their heads , and had offered the crown to Suliman , whom the Prince had left in prison .
18 This noble lord had just been crowned , and the deliverance of the kingdom was the cause of the rejoicing `` For , '' they said , `` he is a good and just man , and we shall once more enjoy peace and prosperity . ''
19 Prince Darling roared with anger when he heard this ; but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace .
20 He saw Suliman seated upon a magnificent throne , and all the people crowded round , wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor .
21 Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent , and said : `` I have accepted the crown you have offered me , but only that I may keep it for Prince Darling , who is not dead as you suppose ; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again , good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the XXXXX .	throne		advice|bull|counsel|deliverance|fury|hands|order|prosperity|throne|times

10 As they approached the town he saw that some great rejoicing was being held , and when the hunters asked what had happened they were told that the Prince , whose only pleasure it was to torment his people , had been found in his room , killed by a thunder-bolt -LRB- for that was what was supposed to have become of him -RRB- .
11 Four of his courtiers , those who had encouraged him in his wicked doings , had tried to seize the kingdom and divide it between them , but the people , who knew it was their bad counsels which had so changed the Prince , had cut off their heads , and had offered the crown to Suliman , whom the Prince had left in prison .
12 This noble lord had just been crowned , and the deliverance of the kingdom was the cause of the rejoicing `` For , '' they said , `` he is a good and just man , and we shall once more enjoy peace and prosperity . ''
13 Prince Darling roared with anger when he heard this ; but it was still worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace .
14 He saw Suliman seated upon a magnificent throne , and all the people crowded round , wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done by his predecessor .
15 Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be silent , and said : `` I have accepted the crown you have offered me , but only that I may keep it for Prince Darling , who is not dead as you suppose ; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may some day see him again , good and virtuous as he was when he first came to the throne .
16 Alas ! ''
17 he continued , `` he was led away by flatterers .
18 I knew his heart , and am certain that if it had not been for the bad influence of those who surrounded him he would have been a good king and a father to his people .
19 We may hate his faults , but let us pity him and hope for his restoration .
20 As for me , I would die gladly if that could bring back our Prince to reign justly and worthily once more . ''
21 These words went to Prince Darling 's heart ; he realized the true affection and faithfulness of his old tutor , and for the first time reproached himself for all his evil deeds ; at the same instant he felt all his anger melting away , and he began quickly to think over his past life , and to admit that his XXXXX was not more than he had deserved .	punishment		Fairy|courtiers|lord|man|pit|prison|punishment|room|snake|wolf

1 The Fairy had scarcely finished speaking when Prince Darling saw to his horror that her words were fulfilled .
2 He had a lion 's head , a bull 's horns , a wolf 's feet , and a snake 's body .
3 At the same instant he found himself in a great forest , beside a clear lake , in which he could see plainly the horrible creature he had become , and a voice said to him : `` Look carefully at the state to which your wickedness has brought you ; believe me , your soul is a thousand times more hideous than your body . ''
4 Prince Darling recognized the voice of the Fairy Truth and turned in a fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could ; but he saw no one , and the same voice went on : `` I laugh at your powerlessness and anger , and I intend to punish your pride by letting you fall into the hands of your own subjects . ''
5 The Prince began to think that the best thing he could do would be to get as far away from the lake as he could , then at least he would not be continually reminded of his terrible ugliness .
6 So he ran toward the wood , but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which had been made to trap bears , and the hunters , who were hiding in a tree , leaped down , and secured him with several chains , and led him into the chief city of his own kingdom .
