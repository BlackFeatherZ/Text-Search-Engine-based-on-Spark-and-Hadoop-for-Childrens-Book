16 When they all wakened next morning , their first ideas were confused .
17 It is often confusing to waken in a strange bed , much more so when you have flown through the air , like the king , the queen , and Benson the butler .
18 For her part , the queen was the most perplexed of all ; for she did undeniably wake , and yet she was not at home , where she had expected to be .
19 However , she was a determined woman , and stood to it that nothing unusual was occurring .
20 The butler made up his mind to claim the crown princeship and the hand of the Lady Molinda ; because , as he justly remarked to William , here was such a chance to better himself as might not soon come in his way again .
21 As for the XXXXX , he was only anxious to get back to Falkenstein , and have the whole business settled in a constitutional manner .	king		drawing-room|home|ideas|justice|king|part|prince|room|wife|woman

16 For the king disliked him as much as ever , and was as angry as ever about the deaths of Enrico and Alphonso .
17 Nay , he was even more angry ; and , perhaps , not without reason .

8 This ended the case ; and Benson , after being entertained with sherry and sandwiches in the steward 's room , was sent back to his master .
9 And I regret to say that his temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself .

15 The king , whose mind did not work very quickly , took some minutes to think over it .
16 Then he saw that by granting the prince 's conditions , he would either recover his dear sons , or , at least , get rid of Prigio , without the unpleasantness of having him executed .
17 For , though some kings have put their eldest sons to death , and most have wished to do so , they have never been better loved by the people for their Roman virtue .

1 CHAPTER XVII .
2 The Black Cat and the Brethren !
3 Who was glad to see the prince , if it was not Lady Rosalind ?
4 The white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment , and then back to white again , they were so alarmed at the change .
5 So the two went into the gardens together , and talked about a number of things ; but at last the prince told her that , before three days were over , all would be well , or all would be over with him .
6 For either he would have brought his brothers back , sound and well , to Falkenstein , or he would not survive his dishonour .
7 `` It is no more than right , '' he said ; `` for had I gone first , neither of them would have been sent to meet the monster after I had fallen .
8 And I should have fallen , dear Rosalind , if I had faced the Firedrake before I knew you . ''
9 Then when she asked him why , and what good she had done him , he told her all the story ; and how , before he fell in love with her , he did n't believe in fairies , or Firedrakes , or caps of darkness , or anything nice and impossible , but only in horrid useless facts , and chemistry , and geology , and arithmetic , and mathematics , and even political economy .
10 And the Firedrake would have made a mouthful of him , then .
11 So she was delighted when she heard this , almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most difficult adventure .
12 For it was one thing to egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake , and quite another to find the princes if they were alive , and restore them if they were dead !
13 But the prince said he had his plan , and he stayed that night at the ambassador 's .
14 Next morning he rose very early , before anyone else was up , that he might not have to say `` Good-bye '' to Lady Rosalind .
15 Then he flew in a moment to the old lonely castle , where nobody went for fear of ghosts , ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein .
16 How still it was , how deserted ; not a sign of life , and yet the prince was looking everywhere for some living thing .

1 The Black Cat and the Brethren !
2 Who was glad to see the prince , if it was not Lady Rosalind ?
3 The white roses of her cheeks turned to red roses in a moment , and then back to white again , they were so alarmed at the change .
4 So the two went into the gardens together , and talked about a number of things ; but at last the prince told her that , before three days were over , all would be well , or all would be over with him .
5 For either he would have brought his brothers back , sound and well , to Falkenstein , or he would not survive his dishonour .
6 `` It is no more than right , '' he said ; `` for had I gone first , neither of them would have been sent to meet the monster after I had fallen .
7 And I should have fallen , dear Rosalind , if I had faced the Firedrake before I knew you . ''
8 Then when she asked him why , and what good she had done him , he told her all the story ; and how , before he fell in love with her , he did n't believe in fairies , or Firedrakes , or caps of darkness , or anything nice and impossible , but only in horrid useless facts , and chemistry , and geology , and arithmetic , and mathematics , and even political economy .
9 And the Firedrake would have made a mouthful of him , then .
10 So she was delighted when she heard this , almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most difficult adventure .
11 For it was one thing to egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake , and quite another to find the princes if they were alive , and restore them if they were dead !
12 But the prince said he had his plan , and he stayed that night at the ambassador 's .
13 Next morning he rose very early , before anyone else was up , that he might not have to say `` Good-bye '' to Lady Rosalind .
14 Then he flew in a moment to the old lonely castle , where nobody went for fear of ghosts , ever since the Court retired to Falkenstein .
15 How still it was , how deserted ; not a sign of life , and yet the prince was looking everywhere for some living thing .
16 He hunted the castle through in vain , and then went out to the stable-yard ; but all the dogs , of course , had been taken away , and the farmers had offered homes to the poultry .
17 At last , stretched at full length in a sunny place , the prince found a very old , half-blind , miserable cat .

19 But cats do not look far into the future ; and this old black cat -- Frank was his name -- had got a breakfast somehow , and was happy in the sun .
20 The prince stood and looked at him pityingly , and he thought that even a sick old cat was , in some ways , happier than most men .
21 `` Well , '' said the XXXXX at last , `` he could not live long anyway , and it must be done .	prince		ambassador|castle|change|fairies|fur|milk|name|plan|prince|sound

20 Then he drew the sword of sharpness , and with one turn of his wrist cut the cat 's head clean off .

12 `` Hullo , Prigio ! ''

1 And there was a little heap of grey ashes .
2 The prince poured a few drops of the water from the Fountain of Lions on them , and up , of course , jumped Enrico , just as Alphonso had done .
3 `` Sleepy old chap you are , Enrico , '' said the prince ; `` but come on , Alphonso will have finished the grub unless we look smart . ''
4 So back they came , in time to get their share of what was going ; and they drank the Remora 's very good health , when Prigio told them about the fight .
5 But neither of them ever knew that they had been dead and done for ; because Prigio invented a story that the mountain was enchanted , and that , as long as the Firedrake lived , everyone who came there fell asleep .
6 He did tell them about the flying carpet , however , which of course did not much surprise them , because they had read all about it in the Arabian Nights and other historical works .
7 `` And now I 'll show you fun ! ''
8 said Prigio ; and he asked them both to take their seats on the carpet , and wished to be in the valley of the Remora .
9 There they were in a moment , among the old knights whom , if you remember , the Remora had frozen into stone .
10 There was quite a troop of them , in all sorts of armour -- Greek and Roman , and Knight Templars like Front de Boeuf and Brian du Bois Gilbert -- all the brave warriors that had tried to fight the Remora since the world began .
11 Then Prigio gave each of his brothers some of the water in their caps , and told them to go round pouring a drop or two on each frozen knight .
12 And as they did it , lo and behold !
13 each knight came alive , with his horse , and lifted his sword and shouted : `` Long live Prince Prigio ! ''
14 in Greek , Latin , Egyptian , French , German , and Spanish , -- all of which the prince perfectly understood , and spoke like a native .
15 So he marshalled them in order , and sent them off to ride to Falkenstein and cry : `` Prince Prigio is coming ! ''
16 Off they went , the horses ' hoofs clattering , banners flying , sunshine glittering on the spear-points .
17 Off they rode to Falkenstein ; and when the king saw them come galloping in , I can tell you he had no more notion of hanging Prigio .
