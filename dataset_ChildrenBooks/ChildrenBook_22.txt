7 All this succeeded according to his desire ; for , the Ogre waking about midnight , and sorry that he deferred to do that till morning which he might have done over-night , threw himself hastily out of bed , and , taking his great knife , `` Let us see , '' said he , `` how our little rogues do , and not make two jobs of the matter . ''
8 He then went up , groping all the way , into his daughters ' chamber , and , coming to the bed where the little boys lay , and who were every soul of them fast asleep , except Little Thumb , who was terribly afraid when he found the Ogre fumbling about his head , as he had done about his brothers ' , the Ogre , feeling the golden crowns , said : `` I should have made a fine piece of work of it , truly ; I find I drank too much last night . ''
9 Then he went to the bed where the girls lay ; and , having found the boys ' little bonnets , `` Ah ! ''
10 said he , `` my merry lads , are you there ?
11 Let us work as we ought . ''
12 And saying these words , without more ado , he cut the throats of all his seven daughters .
13 Well pleased with what he had done , he went to bed again to his wife .
14 So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore , he waked his brothers , and bade them all put on their clothes presently and follow him .
15 They stole down softly into the garden , and got over the wall .
16 They kept running about all night , and trembled all the while , without knowing which way they went .
17 The Ogre , when he awoke , said to his wife : `` Go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night . ''
18 The wife was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband , not dreaming after what manner she should dress them ; but , thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes , she went up , and was strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed , and weltering in their blood .
19 She fainted away , for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases .
20 The Ogre , fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered , went up himself to help her .
21 He was no less amazed than his XXXXX at this frightful spectacle .	wife		crowns|desire|distance|girls|head|lads|soul|throats|upstairs|wife

18 He threw a pitcher of water upon his wife 's face , and , having brought her to herself , said : `` Give me quickly my boots of seven leagues , that I may go and catch them . ''
19 He went out , and , having run over a vast deal of ground , both on this side and that , he came at last into the very road where the poor children were , and not above a hundred paces from their father 's house .
20 They espied the Ogre , who went at one step from mountain to mountain , and over rivers as easily as the narrowest kennels .
21 Little XXXXX , seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were , made his brothers hide themselves in it , and crowded into it himself , minding always what would become of the Ogre .	Thumb		Thumb|bed|blood|husband|manner|rascals|spectacle|upstairs|women|words

11 As it was impossible he could be more weary than he was , he fell asleep , and , after reposing himself some time , began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he held up his great knife and was going to cut their throats .
12 Little Thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers , and told them that they should run away immediately toward home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly , and that they should not be in any pain about him .

15 The boots were very long and large , but , as they were fairies , they had the gift of becoming big and little , according to the legs of those who wore them ; so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him .
16 He went immediately to the Ogre 's house , where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the Ogre 's murdered daughters .
17 `` Your husband , '' said Little Thumb , `` is in very great danger , being taken by a gang of thieves , who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver .
18 The very moment they held their daggers at his throat he perceived me , and desired me to come and tell you the condition he is in , and that you should give me whatsoever he has of value , without retaining any one thing ; for otherwise they will kill him without mercy ; and , as his case is very pressing , he desired me to make use -LRB- you see I have them on -RRB- of his boots , that I might make the more haste and to show you that I do not impose upon you . ''
19 The good woman , being sadly frightened , gave him all she had : for this Ogre was a very good husband , though he used to eat up little children .

19 There are many people who do not agree in this circumstance , and pretend that Little Thumb never robbed the Ogre at all , and that he only thought he might very justly , and with a safe conscience , take off his boots of seven leagues , because he made no other use of them but to run after little children .

1 In vain , however , for the robbers with their sabres soon killed him .
2 On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready , and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret .
3 They cut Cassim 's body into four quarters , and nailed them up inside the cave , in order to frighten anyone who should venture in , and went away in search of more treasure .
4 As night drew on Cassim 's wife grew very uneasy , and ran to her brother-in-law , and told him where her husband had gone .
5 Ali Baba did his best to comfort her , and set out to the forest in search of Cassim .
6 The first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother .
7 Full of horror , he put the body on one of his asses , and bags of gold on the other two , and , covering all with some fagots , returned home .
8 He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard , and led the other to Cassim 's house .
9 The door was opened by the slave Morgiana , whom he knew to be both brave and cunning .
10 Unloading the ass , he said to her : `` This is the body of your master , who has been murdered , but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed .
11 I will speak with you again , but now tell your mistress I am come . ''
12 The wife of Cassim , on learning the fate of her husband , broke out into cries and tears , but Ali Baba offered to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his counsel and leave everything to Morgiana ; whereupon she agreed , and dried her eyes .
13 Morgiana , meanwhile , sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges .
14 `` My poor master , '' she said , `` can neither eat nor speak , and no one knows what his distemper is . ''
15 She carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping , and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die .
16 Thus , in the evening , no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim 's wife and Morgiana , telling everyone that Cassim was dead .
17 The day after Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early , put a piece of gold in his hand , and bade him follow her with his needle and thread .
18 Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief , she took him to the room where the body lay , pulled off the bandage , and bade him sew the quarters together , after which she covered his eyes again and led him home .
19 Then they buried Cassim , and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave , weeping and tearing her hair , while Cassim 's wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries .

17 Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest , he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant .

5 One night , as he was tossing about in bed , full of cares and worry , he sighed and said to his wife : `` What 's to become of us ?
6 how are we to support our poor children , now that we have nothing more for ourselves ? ''
7 `` I 'll tell you what , husband , '' answered the woman ; `` early to-morrow morning we 'll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood ; there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread ; then we 'll go on to our work and leave them alone .
8 They wo n't be able to find their way home , and we shall thus be rid of them . ''
9 `` No , wife , '' said her husband , `` that I wo n't do ; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood ?
10 The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces . ''
11 `` Oh !

13 `` But I ca n't help feeling sorry for the poor children , '' added the husband .
14 The children , too , had not been able to sleep for hunger , and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father .
15 Grettel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel : `` Now it 's all up with us . ''
16 `` No , no , Grettel , '' said Hansel , `` do n't fret yourself ; I 'll be able to find a way to escape , no fear . ''
17 And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up , slipped on his little coat , opened the back door and stole out .
18 The moon was shining clearly , and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver .
19 Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in .
20 Then he went back and said to Grettel : `` Be comforted , my dear little sister , and go to sleep : God will not desert us '' ; and he lay down in bed again .
