# Text-Search-Engine-based-on-Spark-and-Hadoop-for-Childrens-Book
A search engine based on Hadoop and Spark.

Developed a search engine to retrieve text contents in childrenâ€™s books distributed stored on different nodes in a Hadoop/HDFS cluster, and ranked them according to the relevance using TFIDF.

Exploited Spark to find the 20 most relevant books, and developed a web interface which enables downloading and reading them.
